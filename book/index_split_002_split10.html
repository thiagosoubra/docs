<p>Recall and Analysis</p>
<p><b>Why Is It Difficult to Remember an Out-of-Body Experience? </b></p>
<p>Although most people project, at least unconsciously, every night, few of us recall our projections when we wake up in the morning. </p>
<p>The reason for this is very clear. </p>
<p> <i><b>When  we  are  projected  the  physical  brain  is  asleep  and  not involved  in  what  is  going  on  outside  the  body;  it  is  the  para-brain that is engaged when we’re projected and that stores the details of our  extraphysical  experiences. </b></i>  Successful  recollection  of extraphysical  events  depends  then  upon  the  transmission  or "downloading”  of  the  details  from  the  para-brain  to  the  physical brain. The structure and nature of the recollection of a projection in the isolated mental body is even richer, more complex and difficult, as the  transferral  of  the  memory  is  performed  twice:  first,  from  the mental body  to the  brain of the  extraphysical body  (the  para-brain) and then from the para-brain to the physical brain of the human body. </p>
<p>I  wish  I  could  tell  you  there  is  a  simple  method  for  passing  such memories  from  one  vehicle  of  manifestation  to  another  but  there  is none  known  to  date,  simple  or  otherwise.  We  can  facilitate  this process however, by improving the performance of our physical brain. </p>
<p>Be  sure  to  get  sufficient  rest  and  avoid  being  tired  all  the  time  for example; exercise your memory regularly; create new connections in your  brain  that  accurately  reflect  multidimensional  reality  and  can process  experiences  that  lie  beyond  the  norms  of  ordinary,  physical life;  make  sure  there  is  a  good  circulation  of  blood  flowing  to  your brain; and consider taking vitamins or supplements that research has proven to improve mental efficiency. </p>
<p><b>The Importance of Extraphysical Lucidity to the Recall of Extraphysical Events</b></p>
<p><a id="p232"></a>Many other factors can also affect our recall of extraphysical events, such as the depth of the altered state of consciousness we experienced when projected, our interest in remembering and even certain aspects of our personality. These will be discussed in more detail further on. </p>
<p> <i><b>Probably the most important factor in determining whether or not we recall our projections is our level of lucidity outside the body. If we are lucid we understand well what is happening. We are certain that  we  are  projected  and  not  dreaming  or  in  the  normal,  waking state,  and  we  have  control  over  our  projections.  Our  lucidity,  in other  words,  determines  the  quality  of  our  experiences  in  the extraphysical  dimension  and  this  in  turn  affects  our  ability  to remember them. </b></i></p>
<p>To state an obvious example, if you are sleeping outside the body in an  unconscious  state,  you  won’t  know  that  you’re  projected  at  the time and, because of that, won’t be able to remember that you were projected when you wake up. </p>
<p>Whether  we  are  lucid  or  not  outside  the  body  is  not  an  all  or nothing  scenario  though.  We  can  experience  different  levels  of lucidity when we’re projected just as we can when we’re awake. On a good  day  physically  we  know  we  can  analyze  things  quickly  and accurately,  be  productive,  multi-task,  and  concentrate  well  on  what we’re doing without getting distracted. On other days we are not so lucid—we go out and forget to lock the front door, we have to take a nap  after  lunch,  we  forget  an  appointment  or  meeting,  we  can’t remember where we left our glasses—we’re just not paying attention. </p>
<p>Our  level  of  lucidity  can  also  fluctuate  throughout  the  day.  Some people are very alert as soon as they get up in the morning but then hit a wall after lunch. Others are mentally sluggish before lunch and produce their best work at night. </p>
<p>The  energies  of  certain  places  can  also  affect  our  lucidity. </p>
<p>Sometimes  we  feel  drowsy  when  we  visit  a  hospital,  for  example, because everyone there is sleeping. </p>
<p>Our  extraphysical  lucidity  is  no  different.  It  varies  from  one projection to another, can fluctuate during a single projection, and is subject to external influences. </p>
<p>So  as  a  first  step  towards  improving  the  recollection  of  our projections,  we  need  to  try  to  improve  our  level  of  extraphysical, <a id="p233"></a>lucidity. And to do this we need to work on being more lucid, more consistently, in our everyday physical lives. Try to be more alert, pay more attention to detail, focus well on what you are doing, observe what’s  going  on  around  you  with  more  accuracy  and  avoid overindulging in substances that can lower your lucidity in the long-term as well as the short-term, such as alcohol and drugs. </p>
<p><b>Factors That Favor Recall</b></p>
<p>While  a  good  level  of  extraphysical  lucidity  plays  a  key  role,  many other factors can aid the recall of our projections, such as:</p>
<p>•   our level  of  motivation to  produce conscious  projections  at will; </p>
<p>•  lying in the dorsal position (on your back); </p>
<p>•  waking immediately after a projection; </p>
<p>•  projecting with lucidity in the second half of the night; </p>
<p>•  having a good memory in the normal, physical, waking state; </p>
<p>•  orally relating the experience to someone upon awakening; </p>
<p>•  immediately writing down the details upon awakening (the longer you wait to record the experience, the more detail will be lost); </p>
<p>•  and simple extraphysical episodes are usually easier to remember than  more  complicated  scenarios.  For  example,  you  are  more likely  to  remember  a  projection  in  which  you  woke  up  outside the  body  and  found  yourself  suspended  in  a  void  than  a projection to an extraphysical extraterrestrial space station. </p>
<p><b>Factors Unfavorable to Recall</b></p>
<p>Research has shown that the following factors may interfere with the recall of extraphysical events:</p>
<p>•    lack  of  interest  in  projecting,  scepticism  regarding  lucid projection and fear of projecting. (Note: you can be subject to any or all of these factors, however, and still experience and recall a lucid  projection,  so  it  can’t  be  said  that  any  of  these  factors prevent recollection.)</p>
<p>•  lying in the prone position (on your stomach)</p>
<p><a id="p234"></a><img src="index-234_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p>•  surrendering to sleep</p>
<p>•  laziness</p>
<p>•  intoxication</p>
<p>•  postponing the recording of the experience</p>
<p>•  the heavy burden of your daily commitments; for example, being consumed with thoughts of the innumerable tasks you have to  complete  in  the  day  from  the  second  you  wake  up  in  the morning  is  not  conducive  to  recalling  the  previous  night’s projections. </p>
<p><b>Types of Recall</b></p>
<p>The recollection of time spent outside the body occurs in one of two ways.  It  may  be  fragmented,  meaning  only  “snapshots”  of  the projection are recalled. As this type of recollection is incomplete, it is subject to mistakes and is not an efficient method of recall. But if you are  willing  to  apply  some  effort  you  can  try  to  piece  the  whole projection  together  by  concentrating  hard  on  trying  to  remember what happened just before each “snapshot” and what happened just after; linking each isolated memory to another until you are able to connect all the fragments and recall the experience in its entirety, as shown in this diagram. </p>
<p><b>Fragmented recall</b></p>
<p>Obviously this won’t work if the various snapshots recalled are related to different projections. </p>
<p>The most efficient method for recalling extraphysical facts is  <i>en bloc</i> or  continuous  recall  in  which  the  projector’s  lucidity  never  lapses from the physical waking state prior to the projection, throughout the take-off  of  the  consciousness,  the  time  spent  in  the  extraphysical dimension, the return of the consciousness to the physical body, and the return to the waking condition. In this sense, there is nothing to, <a id="p235"></a>actually recall as nothing was ever forgotten. Unfortunately, this type of recall is quite rare. </p>
<p><b>Tips for Recalling Projections</b></p>
<p>There are certain measures you can take during the different stages of the  projective  cycle  that  may  help  you  to  remember  the  projection. </p>
<p>Here are some tips. </p>
<p><b>Prior to the Projection</b></p>
<p>You  now  know  that  recall  is  closely  linked  to  the  level  of extraphysical lucidity experienced during the projection. Put simply, no  lucidity—no  recall.  So  as  part  of  your  preparations  to  project, employ  an  auto-suggestion  and  repeat  your  objective  ten  times.  “I want to be lucid outside the body and I want to recall  <i>everything</i> when I  wake  up.”  In  other  words,  program  yourself  to  remember  your experiences. </p>
<p><b>During the Night</b></p>
<p>If you wake up during the night, rather than immediately turning over and  going  back  to  sleep,  wake  yourself  up  properly  and  try  to remember what was happening just before you woke up. </p>
<p><b>While You Are Projected</b></p>
<p>Pay close attention to what is happening when you are projected and try to memorize the events that have already occurred. And then, if you  need,  decide  to  return  to  your  body  and  write  down  the experiences you had. </p>
<p><b>After the Projection</b></p>
<p>Resist  the  temptation  to  sleep  when  you  wake  after  a  projection. </p>
<p>Instead, move your head a little to bring blood to the brain, then lie quietly for a few minutes and go over the extraphysical events twice in your mind. Immediately write down everything you remember or tell  your  partner  if  he  or  she  is  open  to  and  can  relate  to  your experiences.  This  will  help  bring  more  information  and  details  to mind. </p>
<p><b>Upon Awakening</b></p>
<p>Sometime  we  wake  up  with  no  ideas  or  memories  of  anything  that, <a id="p236"></a>happened  while  we  were  asleep,  so  assume  that  we  haven’t  had  a projection.  In  this  case,  you  can  run  a  check  on  your  physiological condition  to  help  ascertain  whether  or  not  a  projection  actually occurred,  as  some  conditions  can  suggest  in  fact  that  one  has.  For example:</p>
<p>•  an unaltered physical position during one section of the night</p>
<p>•  torpidity</p>
<p>•  cracking noises in the joints</p>
<p>•  a good physical disposition</p>
<p>•  a full bladder</p>
<p>•    a  lowered  temperature  and  heart  rate  (can  be  caused  by  a prolonged projection). </p>
<p><b>Analysis of Extraphysical Events</b></p>
<p>I have a friend who doesn’t believe in out-of-body experiences, which amuses  me  no  end  because  he  has  them  all  the  time!  I  know  that because he’s always telling me about the wonderful “dreams” he has in which he feels as if he’s awake only everything seems clearer and he perceives much more. He’s usually flying in these apparent dreams and often comments on the joy of it and how much he loves to watch the  landscapes  change  beneath  him.  He  also  tells  me  that  when something  catches  his  eye  that  he  wants  to  inspect  more  closely  he glides down to get a better look, and that flying so fast just feet above the ground is a huge thrill. The clarity of his thinking, his euphoria when  flying,  and  particularly  the  fact  that  he’s  in  control  of  his experiences, are all hallmarks of a lucid projection. </p>
<p>My friend’s incorrect analysis of his experiences is very common. A lucid projection is an altered state of consciousness that people often confuse  with  many  other  altered  state  of  consciousness  such  as ordinary  dreams,  lucid  dreams,  projective  catalepsy,  daydreams, nightmares,  double  awareness,  hallucination,  the  hypnagogic  and hypnopompic  states  (the  transition  states  between  wakefulness  and sleep, and vice versa, respectively), hypnotic trances, psychedelic trips and meditation. Similarly, lucid projections can also be mistaken for a number  of  related  parapsychic  occurrences  such  as  travelling clairvoyance,  remote  viewing,  retrocognition,  precognition, panoramic view and physical bilocation. </p>
<p><a id="p237"></a>So I’m now going to define and examine the characteristics of some of  the  altered  states  of  consciousness  and  parapsychic  phenomena most often confused with lucid projection in case you need any help to accurately classify any experiences that lie beyond the pattern of your normal physical waking state. With knowledge and practice, and particularly if you faithfully record all of your experiences in writing, in time you will become skilled at correctly analyzing your own lucid projections. </p>
<p><b>Lucid Projection</b></p>
<p>A  lucid  projection  is  simply  defined  as  the  act  of  one  vehicle  of manifestation  (either  the  extraphysical  body  or  the  mental  body) leaving another. </p>
<p><b>Ordinary Dreams</b></p>
<p>The  table  opposite,  based  on  information  presented  in  the  IAC’s Consciousness  Development  Program,  shows  the  characteristics  that differentiate a conscious projection from an ordinary dream. </p>
<p><b>Lucid Dreams</b></p>
<p>A  lucid  dream  (in  which  you  know  that  you  are  dreaming  and  are able to enter into and participate in the dream) can be classified as a semi-lucid projection. As you gain experience of lucid projection, it is likely  that  your  dreams  will  become  more  rational  and  less incoherent,  permitting  you  to  exercise  your  critical  judgment  and discover that you are dreaming. This is how a lucid dream becomes a lucid  projection.  The  most  efficient  technique  for  inducing  a  lucid projection through a lucid dream, for upgrading your lucidity outside the  body  and  gaining  awareness  of  your  projected  state,  is  to  ask yourself  the  following  question  as  often  as  possible,  in  all environments  and  circumstances,  every  day  for  at  least  one  month:</p>
<p> <i>“Am I awake or am I asleep?” </i></p>
<p><b>Conscious projection</b></p>
<p><b>Dream</b></p>
<p>Departure from the physical body can</p>

<p>An objective reality (such as when you</p>
<p>Not an objective, <a id="p238"></a>capture information whilst outside the experience. </p>
<p>body that you are later able to confirm when inside the body). </p>
<p>Projectors participate in and can</p>
<p>Dreamers are passive, </p>
<p>control a projection. </p>
<p>i.e. things happen to them, they do not make things happen. </p>
<p>Environments, scenes, images and</p>
<p>Images and situations encounters with others are real. </p>
<p>are products of the imagination or nightmares; and are often lacking in rationality and coherency. </p>
<p>Events take place outside the physical</p>

<p>Sensorial stimulation</p>
<p>cord to retract and the consciousness</p>
<p>generates further images, <a id="p239"></a>to return to the physical body. </p>
<p>in the dream. </p>
<p><b>Clairvoyance</b></p>
<p>Clairvoyance is the capacity to perceive the extraphysical dimension while inside the physical body. Examples of this include being able to perceive extraphysical beings and other people’s auras. Clairvoyance is easily distinguished from a projection because you feel yourself to be inside the body. </p>
<p><b>Traveling Clairvoyance</b></p>
<p>Traveling clairvoyance can best be described as a set of instantaneous partial mini-projections in which the extraphysical visual capacity of the  consciousness  extends  out  and  perceives  nonphysical  beings, images, scenes or events taking place either near to or far from the physical body. As the consciousness itself remains inside the physical body, the person is able to provide a simultaneous, live, oral report of what he perceives and again, is very aware of being inside the body. </p>
<p>With  traveling  clairvoyance,  you  can  see  things  but  you  can’t interact or interfere with anything. The maximum you can achieve is a degree of energetic presence. In a projection by contrast, you can act and participate in the experience. </p>
<p>The  other  point  to  clarify  here  is  that  in  order  for  a  person  to communicate  real-time  perceptions  of  the  extraphysical  dimension through speech, the consciousness must be headquartered inside the physical brain; in other words, it is not possible to have an OBE and talk,  walk,  or  perform  any  other  action  with  the  physical  body simultaneously.  So  when  people  orally  report  “live”  extraphysical events they are either channeling, imagining things, or experiencing traveling clairvoyance, remote viewing, intuition or other phenomena. </p>
<p><b>Remote Viewing</b></p>
<p>Remote  viewing  is  basically  a  synonym  of  traveling  clairvoyance. </p>
<p>Vieira describes it in  <i>Projectiology</i> as “a daydream with some flashes of awareness or clairvoyance at a distance.” While traveling clairvoyance allows you to perceive things in more subtle dimensions, with remote viewing  you  only  see  things  in  the  physical  dimension—not  in  the extraphysical  dimension.  Remote  viewing  can  also  be  used  as  a technique for prompting a lucid projection. (Vieira, 2002)</p>
<p><a id="p240"></a><b>Retrocognition</b></p>
<p>A  retrocognition,  in  which  a  person  captures  or  recalls  information, scenes, relationships, experiences and events related to a past life, can occur  while  the  consciousness  is  either  inside  or  fully  projected outside the human body. When a retrocognition occurs during a lucid projection it is known as  <i>extraphysical retrocognition. </i></p>
<p><b>Precognition</b></p>
<p>A  precognition,  in  which  a  person  captures  information,  scenes, relationships, experiences and events pertaining to the future, can also occur while the consciousness is either inside or fully projected from the human body. A precognition that occurs during a lucid projection is known as  <i>extraphysical precognition. </i></p>
<p><b>Projective Panoramic View</b></p>
<p>A projective panoramic view, in which scenes of a period of one’s life or  one’s  entire  life  seem  to  pass  before  the  mind’s  eye,  is  usually experienced when the extraphysical body begins to separate from the human  body  as  the  result  of  a  critical,  near-death  situation.  A projective panoramic view then is a type of projection. </p>
<p><b>Physical Bilocation</b></p>
<p>In  physical  bilocation,  the  extraphysical  body  of  the  projector  semi-materializes outside the body and is clearly perceived by others in the normal physical waking state. I mention this here because witnesses to  this  type  of  projection  sometimes  confuse  this  rare  phenomenon with  clairvoyance.  Physical  bilocation  can  be  considered  as  a  more advanced kind of lucid projection. </p>
<p><b>Diary of Extraphysical Experiences</b></p>
<p>You  may  recall  that  in  <a href="index_split_002_split6.html#p206">chapter  14</a>,  the  chapter  on  preparing  for  a projection,  we  discussed  the  importance  of  adopting  a  scientific approach to your attempts to leave the body and experimenting with all  the  variables  that  affect  your  projectability  until  you  find  a combination that produces results. </p>
<p>In order to be methodical in this approach, to derive the maximum advantage  from  your  efforts,  and  to  progress  your  understanding  of your personal experiences, the ideal is that you make a written report, <a id="p241"></a>of  each  of  your  attempts  to  project,  in  the  form  of  a  diary  of extraphysical  events.  In  this,  you  note  down  the  variables  and circumstances  related  to  each  attempt  and  the  corresponding outcomes, i.e. the details of the projection, parapsychic occurrence or altered state of consciousness you experienced. </p>
<p>This  record,  in  time,  will  greatly  assist  you  in  identifying  the specific combination of factors that produces results. </p>
<p>I suggest then that you keep an exercise book next to your bed for this purpose and that you faithfully record every aspect of everything that happened, regardless or not of whether you think it is important, as soon as you wake up. Certain memories, feelings and issues that are present at that moment might be forgotten later, so aim to capture the experience in writing while the details are fresh in your mind. </p>
<p>Relevant details should also be noted before you lie down such as</p>
<p>•  the time you lie down; </p>
<p>•  the date; </p>
<p>•  the weather; </p>
<p>•  your physical condition (health) and emotional state; </p>
<p>•  your attitude towards projecting; </p>
<p>•    anything  noteworthy  that  happened  during  the  day;  the people  you  met,  the  arguments  you  had,  your  general  state  of mind and certain events, can all have a bearing on what happens outside the body. For example, a colleague of mine left our office to  go  to  McDonalds  for  lunch  one  day  and  passed  a  homeless woman on the way. He was touched by her circumstances and I suspect  felt  some  frustration  at  not  being  able  to  help  her  in  a tangible  way.  Later  that  night  he  found  himself  projected  in  a colony  of  homeless  people  where  he  was  able  to  give  some assistance in the form of energetic healing. </p>
<p>Important  points  related  to  your  extraphysical  experiences  that  you should note in the diary include</p>
<p>•    the  type  of  projection  you  had,  e.g.  was  it  a  leisure projection, did you experience the projection with someone else, did  you  perform  assistance  outside  the  body,  did  you  have  any ideas related to your past lives or to your future; </p>
<p><a id="p242"></a>•  the details of your target; </p>
<p>•    any  sensations  you  experienced  prior  to  the  projection  and during the take-off and landing (refer to<a href="index_split_002_split8.html#p217"> chapter 16)</a>; </p>
<p>•  your level of lucidity, e.g. </p>
<p>•  were you dreaming? </p>
<p>•  were you aware that you were dreaming? </p>
<p>•  did you have some other altered state of consciousness? </p>
<p>•  were you aware of being projected? </p>
<p>•  were you only semi-lucid? </p>
<p>•  could you apply your will with results? </p>
<p>•  did your level of lucidity fluctuate throughout the projection and, if so, do you know why? </p>
<p>•  did you experience the condition of continuous consciousness? </p>
<p>•  the dimensions in which you were projected—the physical, crustal, extraphysical or mental dimension; </p>
<p>•  the dimensions you perceived; </p>
<p>•  whether or not you reached your target; </p>
<p>•  what caused the projection to end; </p>
<p>•  the time you woke up. </p>
<p>Some  final  suggestions  on  how  to  get  the  most  out  of  a  keeping  a diary:</p>
<p>•    Be  neophilic,  be  open  to  new  ideas.  You  will  experience things  in  the  extraphysical  dimension  for  which  you  have  no existing  frame  of  reference.  If  you  try  and  fit  everything  that occurs  extraphysically  into  your  current  understanding  of physical  reality,  you  will  find  it  difficult  to  make  sense  of  or interpret many of your experiences. So write down anything at all that you remember regardless of whether it makes sense to you or seems relevant at the time. </p>
<p>•  Write just for yourself; don’t adjust your style in anticipation of others reading your diary. </p>
<p>•  Be precise, objective and informal. </p>
<p><a id="p243"></a>•  If you can, regularly transfer your notes into a computer so as they  all  remain  together  and  can’t  be  lost.  And  don’t  forget  to make a back-up! </p>
<p>•    And  a  final  reminder—write  the  details  down  as  soon  you wake up. Don’t postpone it. The sooner you write the report the more accurate it will be. (Vieira, 2002)</p>
