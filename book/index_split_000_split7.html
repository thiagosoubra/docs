<p><a id="p16"></a>Introduction</p>
<p>Science is the tool of the Western mind and with it more doors can be  opened  than  with  bare  hands.  It  is  part  and  parcel  of  our knowledge  and  obscures  our  insight  only  when  it  holds  that  the understanding given by it is the only kind there is. </p>
<p> <i>—C.G. Jung. </i></p>
<p>How many of us have had an experience that suggests that a deeper, unseen reality that extends beyond the purely physical is present in our everyday lives? Most of us have probably had an experience with déjà  vu,  intuition,  synchronicity,  premonition  or  telepathy;  felt  an instant sense of recognition or familiarity with a complete stranger; or experienced  a  spontaneous  vibrational  state  …  or  at  least  know  of someone who has. Such indications that our reality is more complex than  it  appears  to  be  and  that  there  is  a  kind  of  ‘backstage’  to  our existence, are commonplace. </p>
<p>Despite this, most people have no direct awareness that we live in a multidimensional environment that extends far beyond the boundaries of our physical world, and that we are, in fact, much more than just our physical bodies. </p>
<p>Fortunately, there is one phenomenon that is natural to all humans that allows us to verify for ourselves, through first-hand  experience, that we are capable of acting entirely independently of the physical body  in  a  nonphysical  dimension  …  the  out-of-body  experience (OBE).  Anyone  who  has  had  a  fully  lucid  OBE,  and  I  count  myself among them, will tell you that if you can be lucid outside the body, you will find that all your mental faculties are fully functioning, that you can make decisions, exercise your free will, access your memory, think  with  a  level  of  clarity  that  sometimes  exceeds  your  usual capacity, and even capture information from the physical dimension that  can  later  be  corroborated  …  and  that  to  experience  all  this provides  you  with  irrefutable  evidence  that  the  physical  body  is merely  a  temporary  ‘house’  through  which  your  consciousness  (i.e your soul or spirit) manifests in the physical world. </p>
<p><a id="p17"></a><img src="index-17_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p>It  is  important  to  make  the  distinction  here  between   <i>the consciousness</i>  and   <i>consciousness. </i>  In  the  context  of  this  book   <i>the consciousness</i> is used as a synonym of soul, spirit, ego, human essence or intelligent principle.  <i>Consciousness</i>—on its own—is typically used to imply  the  state  of  being  aware  or  lucid.  To  avoid  confusion,  some people like to use the word ‘self’ when referring to  <i>the consciousness</i>. </p>
<p><b>Out-of-Body Experience—A Natural Phenomenon</b></p>
<p>I  describe  the  out-of-body  experience  (or  the  projection  of  the consciousness  outside  the  physical  body)  as  a  natural  phenomenon, because almost all humans experience some separation between their physical body and a more subtle nonphysical body every night while they’re  asleep.  The  reason  so  few  of  us  are  aware  of  this  fact  is because  most  of  us  experience  poor  levels  of  awareness  or  lucidity whilst out of the body, don’t remember what happened or confuse the OBE  with  a  dream.  In  reality,  most  people  are  just  sleeping  outside the body, as depicted in the illustration below. </p>
<p><b>Sleeping outside the body (or unconscious projection)</b> But  it  is  possible  to  learn  to  become  more  “awake”  outside  of  the body.  Anyone  who  has  the  will  to  do  this  can  achieve  results.  No particular psychic ability is required. </p>
<p>History  confirms  the  prevalence  and  universality  of  this  unique phenomenon. Human beings have been recording the departure and subsequent  return  of  a  subtle  body  from  the  physical  body  with  a remarkably high degree of consistency since Ancient Egypt, between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago. A look back through history also reveals that  the  OBE  is  common  to  all  people,  regardless  of  their  culture, socio-economic status, gender, language, nationality, age, religion or, <a id="p18"></a>belief system. </p>
<p>Thankfully, in the last few decades, the taboos surrounding the OBE have  diminished,  making  open  discussions  in  public  events  possible and  coverage  in  the  mainstream  media  more  common.  Most significantly, the OBE (particularly the near-death experience (NDE), a type of forced OBE) has begun to attract serious attention from the scientific and medical communities. </p>
<p><b>The Limitations of Conventional Science for the Study of Nonphysical Realities</b></p>
<p>The  perspective  of  conventional  science  (i.e.  materialist,  positivist science,  based  on  the  Cartesian-Newtonian  model  that  considers reality  to  be  physical  only)  is  largely  inadequate  for  the  study  of nonphysical  realities,  however,  because  it  fails  to  take  into  account the possibility that the consciousness can extend beyond the limits of the  physical  dimension,  an  aspect  considered  by  the  sciences represented in this book, to be fundamental to the consciousness. </p>
<p>To put it another way, current scientific convention does not accept that the consciousness can manifest in a nonphysical body such as it does  during  an  OBE,  because  the  existence  of  the  nonphysical  body itself  cannot  be  confirmed,  verified  or  proven  by  objective observation. </p>
<p>Recognizing  that  the  limitations  of  such  an  approach  had  serious ramifications  for  the  advancement  of  human  knowledge,  a  few decades ago one of the world’s foremost authorities on the subject of the consciousness (according to  <i>Who’s Who in the 21st Century</i>, 2002), and a lucid projector since the age of nine, Brazilian researcher Waldo Vieira  M.D.,  began  to  lay  the  groundwork  for  a  more  sophisticated and  inclusive  scientific  approach  to  studying  the  consciousness—a hugely complex endeavor. </p>
<p><b>A New Scientific Approach</b></p>
<p>As  a  result  of  his  own  extensive  personal  experimentation  and research,  and  in  the  face  of  clear-cut  evidence  derived  from  a consensus  of  experience  recorded  by  ordinary  people  around  the world, Vieira had long been aware that a significant amount of human experience lay beyond the reach of the conventional sciences. So he developed  an  approach  that  expanded  upon  existing  scientific, <a id="p19"></a>precepts  to  acknowledge  the  validity  and  value  of   <i>subjective</i> observation and experience. This book is based almost exclusively on his comprehensive leading-edge theories and the personal experiences I have had to validate them. </p>
<p>In  1986,  Vieira  formally  proposed  the  science  of  projectiology  to the  public  and  scientific  communities  with  the  launch  of  a  highly detailed  1200-page  treatise  entitled   <i>Projectiology:  A  Panorama  of Experiences Outside the Human Body</i> (published in the author’s native Portuguese), which has a bibliography of 1,957 entries sourced from 28 countries and 18 different languages. </p>
<p>In 1994 he published the bases for the science of conscientiology in a  second  treatise  entitled   <i>700  Experiments  of  Conscientiology</i>.  The foundation of these new sciences is based on a wider perspective that recognizes the multidimensional nature of existence. Vieira terms this <i>the consciential paradigm</i>. </p>
<p>Conscientiology is the science that studies the consciousness (soul, spirit,  ego,  self,  human  essence),  investigating  all  of  its  properties, attributes, capacities, phenomena, bodies of manifestation and lives, based on the consciential paradigm. </p>
<p>Conscientiology  is  hierarchically  structured  into  a  set  of subdisciplines—70  in  total;  projectiology  being  the  subdiscipline dedicated to the study of the projection of the consciousness outside of the physical body (out-of-body experience, OBE). Projectiology is a particularly important subdiscipline as the OBE is the tool that allows the  individual  (consciousness)  to  be  both  the  researcher  and  the object of study; in other words, it allows the consciousness to observe and study itself. </p>
<p>As  explained  by  Vieira  in  the  introduction  to   <i>Projectiology</i>,  the massive amount of data he gathered in proposing these sciences was obtained from the following sources:</p>
<p>1.  Over  1,100  lucid  projections  that  he  independently  experienced, analyzed and recorded between 1941 and 1985, (60 of which are described  in  Projections  of  the  Consciousness:  A  Diary  of  Out-of-Body Experiences); </p>
<p>2.  Ideas  and  experiences  gathered  from  fortnightly  meetings  with  a team  of  lucid  projectors  from  the  Center  of  Continuous, <a id="p20"></a>Consciousness (CCC), an organization he founded in 1981 in Rio de Janeiro  (now  disbanded),  and  from  monthly  meetings  with  the general public in the cities of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto and other cities in Brazil; </p>
<p>3. Personal correspondence received from hundreds of lucid projectors of  all  levels  from  all  over  the  world.  This  material  is  filed  at  the International Institute of Projectiology and Conscientiology (IIPC), an  organization  that  was  founded  by  Vieira  and  a  group  of researchers from the CCC in 1988, in response to demand in Brazil for  a  more  structured  environment  in  which  to  study  the consciousness.  Vieira  presided  over  the  IIPC,  a  nonprofit organization, for more than ten years; </p>
<p>4. Personal interviews conducted with lucid projectors both in Brazil and all over the world; </p>
<p>5. Direct contact with nonphysical individuals who were, in previous lives,  lucid  projectors  like  Vieira.  Many  of  them  had  studied  the subject and had a wealth of knowledge and experience to impart, others  were  authors  in  past  lives  and  established  a  rapport  and came into contact with Vieira when he was researching their works; 6.  Meetings  and  field  research  that  took  place  in  Brazil  and  abroad, particularly  in  Europe  and  the  US,  with  directors,  editors, researchers  and  members  of  institutions,  laboratories,  studios, bookstores,  private  and  public  universities  and  institutional libraries; </p>
<p>7.  Vieira’s  vast  private  collection  of  technical  works,  dictionaries, anthologies,  treatises,  manuals,  biographies,  magazines, newspapers, periodicals, bulletins, reports, expositions, proceedings and dissertations. </p>
<p>(Vieira, Projectiology). </p>
<p>As  a  result  of  Vieira’s  scientific  approach  to  organizing  an encyclopedic amount of data gathered from such an extensive variety of  sources,  a  clear  consensus  as  to  the  true  nature  of  the  human consciousness  has  emerged,  making  it  possible  to  draw  many conclusions  about  and  largely  demystify  this  great  enigma  of, <a id="p21"></a>mankind. </p>
<p>Age 78 at the time of writing, and with 50 years of research behind him,  Vieira  is  today  based  at  the  campus  of  the  Center  for  Higher Studies  of  Conscientiology  (CHSC)  at  Iguassu  Falls  in  Brazil. </p>
<p>Supported  by  a  team  of  more  than  100  volunteers,  including professional  psychologists,  engineers,  linguists  and  academics,  and drawing on his personal library of some 63,000 items related to the subject of consciousness and associated paranormal phenomena (the largest  personal  library  of  its  kind  in  the  world),  he  continues  to research and add knowledge to a body of information that is already truly quantum in breadth and scale. </p>
<p><b>The Impact of Discovering I Was More Than My Physical Body</b></p>
<p>When I first came across these new sciences in 2001, via the London Educational  Center  of  the  International  Academy  of  Consciousness (IAC),  an  organization  associated  with  Vieira’s  work,  their  value struck me immediately. A series of personal experiences that followed soon after and continue to this day, enabled me to verify enough that my  understanding  of  the  world  around  me,  my  perspective  on  life, and  as  a  consequence,  the  way  I  chose  to  live  it,  was  irrevocably altered. </p>
<p>Knowing  what  I  now  know,  there  will  never  be  any  going  back; meaning,  I  will  never  be  able  to  “unknow”  what  I  have  learned  or deny  my  experiences.  So  it  is  now  a  matter  of  consistently  working towards  living  my  life  in  a  way  that  is  more  coherent  with  what  I know and that allows me and others to benefit from the privilege. </p>
<p>Let  me  explain  why  conscientiology  has  had  such  a  profound impact on my life. It quickly became apparent that through the out-of-body experience we have access to a richer, broader, more complex multidimensional  existence  in  which  the  answers  to  some  of  the questions  that  have  puzzled  humankind  for  many  centuries  were  at hand; questions such as:</p>
<p>What happens when we die? </p>
<p>Where will I go when I die? </p>
<p>What is it like there? </p>
<p><a id="p22"></a>Who else will be there? </p>
<p>Where did I come from? </p>
<p>What is the purpose of my life? </p>
<p>These  questions  are  monumental.  And  they  were  answered  in  a rational,  logical,  nonmystical  and  nonreligious  way,  and  in  a theoretical  and  practical  (personally  verifiable)  scientific  context  by the IAC. </p>
<p>And Pandora’s Box was opened. For I also came to understand that in transcending my physicality, not only do I survive physical death and spend a period afterwards manifesting in a nonphysical body, but that  my  broader  existence  consists  of  countless  such  alternations  of physical lives with nonphysical periods spent between lives. In other words, my current physical incarnation is just one life of many I have already  had,  in  which  I  am  just  one  person  of  many  that  I  have already been. </p>
<p>This  realization  alone  explained  so  many  things  for  me—strong connections I have with certain people, experiences in which I’ve felt a sense of familiarity with and affection for a complete stranger, and some oddities of my personality that seem to have no known cause in this lifetime. Just for starters. </p>
<p>I  also  came  to  realize  that  the  OBE  provides  us  all  with  an invaluable  opportunity  to  visit  and  familiarize  ourselves  with  the dimension in which we will exist after death and to prepare for this certain  eventuality.  This  is  so  important  because  without  such understanding  and  knowledge,  upon  death,  people  can  become confused, traumatized and eventually psychotic as their association of being aware with being alive in the physical dimension is so strong that they’re unable to make any sense of their nonphysical state. This is not to say that this condition is irreversible—it’s entirely possible that a person is able to get a clearer perspective after a period of time. </p>
<p>But for anyone who remains in such a condition, nothing productive comes out of this lengthy period spent between lives. But don’t just take my word for it. You can verify this for yourself by projecting to the dimensions that interact and overlap with physical life to see the condition that some nonphysical individuals are in. </p>
<p>By contrast, if we are lucid after death, we can spend this period between  lives  preparing  for  our  next  physical  life,  planning  its, <a id="p23"></a>purpose and setting goals; goals that relate to advancing our personal development and that of others. It is through processes such as these that  we  mature,  grow,  evolve  and  become  more  balanced  as individuals. </p>
<p>But we don’t have to wait until we die to start this work. We can easily  choose  to  begin  this  process  of  personal  growth  now  by reprioritizing our lives … by prioritizing learning about the broader, multidimensional realities of our existence, and by helping others to do the same. </p>
<p>I decided that this was exactly what I was going to do with my life</p>
<p>… no matter what. </p>
<p><b>A New Direction in Life</b></p>
<p>The “no matter what” part initially consisted of having to exchange paid employment for voluntary work, so I quit my job at the U.N. in Geneva where I was living at the time and moved to London to train to  be  an  instructor  with  the  IAC  and  to  help  raise  awareness  of  its work.  Ten  years  have  since  passed.  I  have  been  back  in  regular employment  for  several  years  now  but  remain  committed  to  my original goals. </p>
<p>Life  is  busier,  more  challenging  and  more  demanding  these  days, but with the challenges comes the personal growth, the expansion of self-awareness, and the immeasurable satisfaction of helping others to see and live their lives in a broader, more meaningful context. There have been several occasions in which I’ve been supervising a practical class, for example, the lights are out and I’m sitting there quietly and still  in  the  dark  while  the  students  practice  a  technique  I’ve  just taught  for  leaving  the  body—and  I  think  to  myself,  there’s  nothing else in the world I’d rather be doing with my time. </p>
<p>During  these  years  working  for  the  IAC,  it  gradually  became apparent  to  me  that  there  was  a  role  to  be  played  as  a  kind  of bridging ‘interpreter’ between Dr. Vieira and lay readers interested in enriching their knowledge of the human consciousness and the wider realities  in  which  we  exist.  Vieira’s  own  books  are  notoriously sophisticated, technical and intellectual in style, but his priority was to  further  human  knowledge  by  faithfully  and  accurately  recording the details of his research, not to write a bestseller. My endeavor, with this  book,  is  to  make  his  work  available  to  a  wider  nonacademic, <a id="p24"></a>audience by presenting it in a language and format that everyone can understand  and  follow,  without  compromising  the  integrity  of  his ideas  in  any  way.  Einstein  once  said  that  “it  should  be  possible  to explain  the  laws  of  physics  to  a  barmaid”  so  I  figure  it  should  be equally possible to explain conscientiology to the general reader. My motivation for making the information more accessible is to provide assistance to those searching for this knowledge. </p>
<p><b>What You Can Learn from This Book and How to Apply It to Your Life</b></p>
<p>In  <a href="index_split_000_split8.html#p28">part  1, </a>  the  foundations  that  are  essential  to  understanding  the broader  context  of  your  existence  are  laid  down;  I  describe,  for example,  the  different  vehicles  or  bodies  in  which  you  (as  a consciousness) can manifest, the various nonphysical dimensions you can visit, the nonphysical beings you can come into contact with in your daily lives (be you inside or outside your body), and bioenergy. </p>
<p>Expect  to  encounter  some  terminology  and  concepts  that  may  seem strange at first, but be patient, remain open and accept that this is a normal  part  of  the  process  of  learning  something  new  and  original. </p>
<p>There is a glossary of terms at the end of the book—if you familiarize yourself  with  it,  you  will  quickly  become  accustomed  to  the terminology.  This  part  of  the  book  is  also  more  theoretical  than practical in nature, out of necessity, although it has several practical sections  nonetheless.  I  mention  this  because  I  encourage  you  to persevere  through  these  chapters,  because  you  have  to  have  the knowledge before you can apply it! </p>
<p>Once you have the necessary information under your belt, the book goes on to describe how you can apply the information in a practical way in your own life, to move forward in your personal development. </p>
<p>You will learn, for example:</p>
<p>•  how to master your energy and use it as a tool to:</p>
<p>•  experience conscious and controlled OBEs</p>
<p>•  increase your psychic abilities</p>
<p>•  develop energetic sensitivity and perception</p>
<p>•  protect yourself energetically from the influences of both physical and nonphysical individuals</p>
<p><a id="p25"></a>•  heal yourself and others</p>
<p>•    how  to  have  more  positive  helpers  (spirit  guides)  and  more positive people around you</p>
<p>•  how to facilitate the recollection of past lives, avoid repeating the  mistakes  of  your  past,  understand  the  karmic  links  that connect  you  to  those  closest  to  you  and  evaluate  the  quality  of those links</p>
<p>•  how to know yourself more completely and realize your full potential  so  you  can  face  and  overcome  your  limitations  and shortcomings through frank self-analysis and get the most out of your strong traits</p>
<p>•  how to identify your purpose in life and move towards it with discernment, conviction and self-motivation</p>
<p>•  how to be more consistently good natured and how to deal better  with  conflict,  misunderstandings  and  resentments  in  your relationships</p>
<p>•    how  to  become  more  mature  and  more  (cosmo)ethical  and thus improve your karma</p>
<p>•  how to exercise more control over your life</p>
<p>•  how to lose your fear of death and prepare yourself for what will happen when you die</p>
<p>•  how to take the maximum opportunity of what this life offers to develop and evolve as an individual</p>
<p>In short, how to be a little less incomplete. </p>
<p><b>How to Handle the Material</b></p>
<p>I  am  not  suggesting  for  a  minute  that  to  understand  how  all  these things work is the same as putting them into practice. You will need a strong  will,  determination,  a  readiness  to  be  frank  about  your  own weak traits and a willingness to practice some new skills until they’re mastered.  You  may  find  that  you  have  to  undo  some  deep-seated conditionings or beliefs that have been ingrained in you since the day you were born (some may even have their roots in past lives), in order to be able to benefit fully from the ideas presented here. And this may precipitate  difficulties  or  even  crises.  You  will  also  need  to  be, <a id="p26"></a>prepared to go against the norms and trends of society and begin the process  of  relying  increasingly  upon  your  own  knowledge,  personal experiences and reference points in order to decide how to make your way  forward.  This  too  can  bring  pressure.  To  give  you  an  example, when I gave up my job in Switzerland to become a volunteer at the IAC,  I  know  some  of  my  friends  had  trouble  accepting  that  I  was prepared to take major decisions about my life based on prioritizing my personal development over the usual concerns, such as status and wealth. </p>
<p>So just be aware that this book is delivering powerful information on  topics  that  are  not  superficial;  please  approach  it  with  common sense and maturity. </p>
<p>There are no quick fixes or shortcuts to enlightenment in this book. </p>
<p>It has taken us 350,000 years (i.e. some thousands of lives) to evolve from caveman to modern day man. We will probably need thousands more lives to reach the point of being so evolved that there is nothing left to learn from being a physical human being and we can discard the  body  for  the  last  time  and  commence  a  period  of  existence  in which we live exclusively in a more subtle body. </p>
<p>I hope you’re still reading! What I can tell you is, if you apply the ideas described in this book to your own life, to the very best of your ability,  you  will  have  ongoing  opportunities  to  reevaluate  and reprioritize your life and to lead a more fulfilling and purposeful life. </p>
<p>You will notice immediate changes and improvements in your life that will  have  positive  consequences  now  and  for  the  remainder  of  your current  physical  life—and  for  the  entirety  of  your  existence.  This  is the journey you’re headed on if you think this book is for you. </p>
<p>A  final  word  on  how  to  handle  the  material  in  this  book;  history shows  us  that  truth  is  not  absolute,  but  is  relative;  that  is,  it  is  a reflection of the best knowledge available to man at any given time. </p>
<p>Neither  Dr.  Vieira  nor  the  many  thousands  of  people  who  are teaching,  studying  or  working  on  furthering  his  original  ideas  are saying that “we have the final knowledge.” No. So I urge you to use your  own  mental  capacities,  your  intellect,  logic,  rationality  and discernment when thinking about the ideas presented here. I cannot encourage you enough to  <i>not</i> just accept everything that is written in these pages but to use the OBE and to have your own experiences and <i>know your own truth</i> for yourself. </p>
<p><a id="p27"></a><b>Safely Producing Out-of-Body Experiences</b> The final part of the book, <a href="index_split_002_split5.html#p205">part 4, </a> is entirely dedicated to helping you have lucid, controlled, out-of-body experiences and to remember them when you return to the normal, physical waking state. A number of techniques are described in detail. Although learning to produce OBEs at will is by no means the sole objective of this book, the OBE is the tool  that  allows  us  to  discover  the  aspects  of  our  existence  that  lie outside of our direct awareness. To this end, its value is immeasurable and to master it is of key importance. </p>
<p>It  is  important  to  point  out  that  if  you  correctly  follow  the instructions  of  the  practical  exercises  in  this  book  that  relate  to producing lucid OBEs, mastering your bioenergies, recalling past lives or any other subject, there is no need for a personal teacher or guide. </p>
<p>It is quite safe for you to work on your own—there is nothing to fear. </p>
<p>Many  myths  and  misconceptions  about  paranormal  phenomena  are totally unfounded and cause a lot of unnecessary apprehension. </p>
<p>My experiences with conscientiology will not necessarily be yours so  I  don’t  focus  on  my  experiences  throughout  this  book.  I acknowledge that we are all individuals with our own histories, with our own unique ways of responding to different information, with the right to exercise our free will and to choose what we want and need from  life.  But  it  is  with  untold  pleasure  that  I  share  here  with  you what  I  have  learned,  so  that  you  can  have  the  opportunities  I  have had, should you be looking for them. </p>
