<p>Common Sensations of the Take-Off and Return</p>
<p>The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  describe  the  various  unusual, sometimes exotic, sensations that are commonly experienced leading up to a projection and also at the moment of the take-off and return of the consciousness. If you have already experienced some of these the information  that  follows  will  serve  to  confirm  that  what  you  think happened  was  real  and  not  imagined  (if  you  are  unsure),  and  to reassure you that what you felt was completely normal. </p>
<p>For  those  of  you  who  have  little  or  no  projective  experience,  the knowledge  you  will  gain  from  this  chapter  will  help  you  to  avoid reacting to some of the sensations with fear or apprehension, because you will understand what is going on and know that many thousands of people before you have had the same experiences. You will also be able  to  anticipate  the  sensations,  and  this  can  greatly  affect  your success  in  leaving  the  body,  because  when  you  start  to  feel  things happening there will be more chance of you maintaining control than becoming startled and unbalanced. </p>
<p> <i><b>Regardless of your level of experience, the key point to take away from  this  chapter  is  that  when  you  feel  any  of  the  sensations  that frequently  precede  or  accompany  the  take-off  (or  return)  of  the consciousness from the physical body, you should feel pleased and happy  because  these  signs  confirm  that  your  attempt  to  project  is working  and  that  you  are  on  the  right  track.  This,  in  turn,  should further motivate you to continue with your experiments. </b></i></p>
<p><b>Signs That a Projection is Imminent</b></p>
<p>Experienced veteran projectors who have had many hundreds of lucid projections  throughout  their  lives,  sometimes  have  an  indication  or sign that an out-of-body experience is going to occur even up to two hours  prior  to  the  actual  projection.  They  may  have  a  powerful intuition  to  go  home,  for  example,  and  start  making  the  necessary preparations. Over time and with practice they are able to identify the, <a id="p228"></a>signs  that  are  precursors  to  a  projection  and  that  enable  them  to forecast the event. </p>
<p>Less experienced projectors however are more likely to have some indication or sign that a projection is imminent immediately prior to the take-off of the consciousness in the extraphysical body. Indications that are most commonly reported include:</p>
<p>•  vivid dreams</p>
<p>•  dreams of flying</p>
<p>•  dreams about lucid projection</p>
<p>•  accelerated digestion</p>
<p>•  sensing the presence of extraphysical consciousnesses</p>
<p>•  the elongation of a para-arm or para-leg</p>
<p>•  a pulsation or pressure on the chakras, particularly the frontal chakra (third eye)</p>
<p>•  a sense of alienation from the physical body</p>
<p>•  the perception of a flow of air or light breeze in the room</p>
<p>•  hearing a whistling or hissing noise</p>
<p>•  the sensation that the light in the room has become brighter <b>Sensations During Take-Off and Return</b></p>
<p>Other  sensations  are  specifically  related  to  the  nonalignment  of  the physical and extraphysical bodies and may therefore be experienced during  both  the  take-off  and  the  return  of  the  consciousness.  These include:</p>
<p>•    numbness—the  temporary  absence  of  sensitivity  and  therefore action of the human body; a feeling similar to having had a local anesthetic; will be accompanied by a lowered heart rate</p>
<p>•    torpidity—apathy,  lethargy,  sluggishness,  listlessness, unresponsiveness, inaction</p>
<p>•  auditory and olfactory hyper-acuity—a heightened ability to hear  and  smell  things  in  the  physical  environment  using  your nonphysical  senses;  e.g.  you  might  hear  noises  from  the  street that  usually  lie  beyond  your  range  of  perception  or  detect  the, <a id="p229"></a>aroma of fresh bread from a bakery several blocks away</p>
<p>•  weightlessness—or lightness of the extraphysical body</p>
<p>•    heaviness—the  sensation  that  the  physical  body  is  a  dead weight</p>
<p>•    undulation—the  instability,  rocking  or  oscillation  of  the extraphysical body</p>
<p>•  ballooning—the clear sensation that the whole body or a part of  the  body  is  growing,  swelling,  expanding  or  inflating  like  a balloon; occurs as a result of the expansion of the energy body</p>
<p>•  vibrational state—in most cases, a vibrational state occurring just prior to a projection will happen spontaneously</p>
<p>•  intracranial sounds—noises that are difficult to characterize; almost always stem from inside the cranium at the exact moment of the lucid take-off and seem to be caused by a very abrupt takeoff  of  the  para-head;  various  projectors  report  hearing intracranial  sounds  such  as  ringing,  jingling,  buzzing,  tinkling, crackles (tinnitus), squeaks, chirps or titters</p>
<p>•    cranial  pressure—a  sensation  that  stems  from  an  acute awareness of the weight of the physical head at the moment of the detachment of the para-head</p>
<p>•    sleep  paralysis  (also  known  as  projective  catalepsy)—the sensation  of  being  unable  to  move  the  physical  body  while consciously  headquartered  inside  it;  may  occur  prior  to  or following a projection</p>
<p>•  disconnection (or reconnection) of the extraphysical body—is sometimes accompanied by a kind of ‘click’ of separation which sounds like Velcro being pulled apart</p>
<p>•  falling sensation followed by jerking awake—is caused by the swift  and  sudden  return  of  the  extraphysical  body;  usually followed by rapid breathing and a pounding heart</p>
<p>•    tunnel  effect—an  intrinsic  component  of  going  from  one dimension to another, can therefore occur in any type of OBE but is  more  common  in  near-death  experiences  (NDEs);  the impression,  usually  immediately  after  takeoff,  of  entering  and traveling  at  great  speed  through  a  long,  dark,  narrow  tunnel, <a id="p230"></a>towards a point of light</p>
<p>•  double perceptions—simultaneous perceptions of the physical and extraphysical dimensions; e.g. you may hear a police siren on the street and an extraphysical conversation at the same time</p>
<p>•    blackout  during  take-off—a  brief  lapse  in  lucidity  that frequently occurs during the transition of our mental operations from the brain to the para-brain, as occurs during the take-off and the landing; is so common in fact that the totally lucid take-off of the  consciousness  is  the  rarest  type  of  take-off  of  all;  can  be combated with the force of will! </p>
<p>Which of these sensations you experience will vary depending on the day and the projection. You may find that all of them, only some, or none of them occur. (Vieira, 2002)</p>
