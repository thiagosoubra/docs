<p>Lucid Projection Techniques</p>
<p>Projecting with lucidity at will is a skill that has to be learned. In this sense, the learning process is not dissimilar to learning a new sport or language.  There  are  no  shortcuts  and  no  substitutes  for  effort  and determination.  If  you  are  really  serious  about  becoming  a  lucid projector, the ideal is that you practice as many techniques as possible and dedicate yourself to training your physical, energy, extraphysical and  mental  bodies  to  adapt  to  the  specific  demands  of  each  one.  I mention this so as you understand that, although not impossible, it is probably  unlikely  that  you  will  have  a  lucid  projection  after  trying one technique just once or twice. </p>
<p>While  there  are  no  perfect  techniques  that  guarantee  success,  the techniques devised by Vieira that I describe in this chapter are among some  of  the  most  effective,  based  on  the  results  of  thousands  of students of the IAC and the IIPC around the world who have applied them in practical classes. </p>
<p>In  addition  to  practicing  all  the  techniques  in  this  chapter  I recommend  that  you  do  some  research  and  put  together  a  set  of around 15–20 to work with in total. Vieira describes 37 in  detail  in <i>Projectiology</i> just for starters. The aim then, after practicing each one every night for a month or so, is to identify five or six that take best advantage of your strong traits and that seem to work well for you. </p>
<p>For example, if you have a good imagination, techniques that require that you use your imagination and visualization will be easier for you; if  you  have  good  lung  capacity,  you  will  find  the  techniques  based around breath control easier to do, and so on. You can even combine certain elements of different techniques that suit you to create your own. </p>
<p> <i><b>Think of your every attempt to project as an opportunity to learn from  all  the  little  details  and  experiences  that  you  have  and  don’t have  any  anxieties  or  expectations  about  what  you  should  achieve beyond that. </b></i></p>
<p><a id="p218"></a>Whatever you find difficult about a certain technique will reveal a limitation or blockage that you have and this is positive, because once you’ve discovered what’s preventing you from leaving the body you can work on overcoming it. Maybe you find that you are not able to relax sufficiently or perhaps you discover that you have an energetic blockage in one of your chakras that is holding you in the body. </p>
<p><b>Tips</b></p>
<p>Before  you  lie  down  to  apply  a  technique,  take  some  time  to  think about how you are going to occupy yourself when you are projected. </p>
<p>If  you  are  busy  outside  the  body  you  will  avoid  thinking  of  your physical  world  and  increase  your  chances  of  staying  projected  for longer. </p>
<p>Some activities you can include on your extraphysical to-do list are:</p>
<p>•  try to fly</p>
<p>•  examine your extraphysical body</p>
<p>•  stretch your extraphysical body</p>
<p>•  test the capacity of your vision (can you see 360 degrees?)</p>
<p>•  change the appearance of your face</p>
<p>•  change your clothes</p>
<p>•  feel your silver cord</p>
<p>•  meet your helpers</p>
<p>•  see if you’re emitting a light. </p>
<p>Include  a  target  in  your  agenda,  something  or  someone  you  are curious to meet or a place that you are really motivated to visit. </p>
<p>Once you have gotten yourself comfortable and are ready to start, there are two important steps to take before applying the projective technique. </p>
<p>First, you should spend 15–20 minutes working with your energies; absorbing  energies  from  the  environment  around  you,  installing  the vibrational state and sending your energies out in all directions (refer back  to  <a href="index_split_000_split12.html#p78">chapter  4</a>  for  detailed  instructions  on  how  to  do  these exercises).  This  will  help  loosen  up  your  energy  body,  which  will make it easier for the extraphysical body to detach and take off. </p>
<p><a id="p219"></a>And  second,  you  must  relax.  I  am  shortly  going  to  describe  the Psychophysiological  Self-Relaxation  Technique.  It  is,  in  itself,  a technique to leave the body, but it can also be used for the purpose of helping to establish a deep state of relaxation prior to applying any other projective technique. Or you can use any other effective method for relaxation that works for you. </p>
<p>As  you  are  going  through  the  steps  of  any  technique  you  will probably  get  distracted  at  some  point  and  find  that  your  mind  has wandered off. When you realize this is happening, no problem, just go back to the beginning of the technique and start again. With time and practice you will improve your ability to concentrate. </p>
<p>Remember, too, that your aim with all the techniques is to relax the body enough to let it sleep but to remain lucid and alert in your mind at the same time. </p>
<p><b>Projective Techniques</b></p>
<p><b>The Psychophysiological Self-Relaxation Technique</b> A deep state of relaxation is a technique for causing the extraphysical body  to  gently  detach  from  the  physical  body  and  float.  You  will easily recognize when the separation has taken place because you will no  longer  be  able  to  feel  your  physical  body.  It  will  feel  numb. </p>
<p>Numbness  is  just  one  of  many  sensations  that  are  commonly experienced when the physical and extraphysical bodies are in a state of  discoincidence  and  this  is  completely  normal.  I  describe  this  and several other sensations in more detail in the next chapter. </p>
<p>To  apply  the  psychophysiological  self-relaxation  technique:  inhale deeply—fill your lungs—then contract or tense a muscle group in your face—e.g. crinkle your forehead—hold your breath for five seconds—</p>
<p>then exhale and relax the muscles as you do so. Then, again, inhale deeply—fill  your  lungs—and  contract  another  muscle  group  in  your face for five seconds—e.g. squeeze your eyes tightly shut—hold your breath for five seconds—then exhale and relax the muscles; and so on, moving through all the muscles in your face. You can push your lips forward, clench your jaw tight, contract your neck muscles, etc. </p>
<p>Continue in this manner, contracting and relaxing all the muscles in your  body:  your  neck,  shoulders,  chest,  arms,  hands  and  fingers, abdominals,  lower  back,  buttocks,  upper  legs,  shins  (pull  your  toes, <a id="p220"></a>toward you), calves, feet and toes. Take all the time you need. There’s no need to rush. </p>
<p>We often carry tension in our bodies without even being aware of it. The idea of this technique is that as you relax each muscle you will release  any  tension  you  are  holding  and  gradually  establish  a  more profound state of relaxation. Once you feel the body becoming numb you will know that the extraphysical body is starting to float. At this point  you  should  concentrate  on  the  target  of  your  projection  to encourage a full projection of the consciousness. </p>
<p><b>The Projective Target Technique</b></p>
<p>Curiosity or motivation to reach a target is a very effective technique for leaving the body. Sometimes after teaching a practical class at the IAC, I would tell students to try to project to the classroom from their homes during the night to see what object I had placed on the desk or what I had written on the whiteboard. More than once students came in the next morning with a word written down on a piece of paper that matches exactly the word written on the whiteboard. When they described how they captured the information, it was clear that they had had a lucid OBE as opposed to an experience with remote viewing or  traveling  clairvoyance.  The  fact  that  the  words  matched  allowed them to confirm their projections. </p>
<p>You could set up just such an experiment yourself by asking a friend to leave an object out on his kitchen table or a colleague to draw a symbol or write a word on a whiteboard at work for you to try to see out of the body. </p>
<p>In  these  examples,  a  place  has  been  chosen  as  the  target  of  the projection,  but  you  could  also  have  a  person  as  your  target,  or  an idea,  or  you  may  even  choose  a  target  that  relates  to  discovering something about yourself, i.e. a self-target. Let’s have a closer look at each of these categories. </p>
<p><b>Places</b></p>
<p>This  category  includes  both  physical  and  extraphysical  places.  A physical  destination  could  be  an  object  or  objects  that  you  have always  wanted  to  see,  such  as  Monet’s  waterlily  series  at  the Orangerie Museum in Paris; or a place that you have always wanted to  visit  but  haven’t  had  the  opportunity  to  do  so  yet,  such  as, <a id="p221"></a>Antarctica, the Serengeti plains or Uluru (Ayers Rock) in Australia. Or perhaps  you  would  like  to  travel  30  leagues  under  the  sea  to  learn what  strange  creatures  live  at  such  depths,  fly  into  the  heart  of  the Krakatau volcano in Indonesia, or visit an international space station orbiting the Earth. </p>
<p>Extraphysically,  you  might  like  to  visit  your  extraphysical hometown and reacquaint yourself with the extraphysical members of your  karmic  group,  or  go  to  an  extraphysical  colony  of  specific interest  to  you,  e.g.  a  colony  of  pacifists,  ecologists,  geniuses  or politicians.  Remember  too  that  every  physical  place  has  an extraphysical  “backstage.”  So  you  might  choose  as  your  target  the extraphysical  territory  and  community  associated  with  the headquarters of the United Nations, the Peace Palace in The Hague, or with your own home or place of work. What is it like there? Who is there? What is happening there? </p>
<p><b>Places That Are Off-Limits</b></p>
<p>There are some human districts and extraphysical environments that projectors  should  avoid  and  consider  to  be  off-limits  due  to  the existence of potential or actual risks; such as:</p>
<p>•    Houses  that  are  known  to  be  haunted  by  poltergeists. </p>
<p>Poltergeists  are  extraphysical  consciousnesses  that  have  the ability to produce effects in the physical dimension. If you project to a haunted house, a poltergeist might be hostile towards you or even follow you home and create problems for you there. </p>
<p>•  Places where violent crimes have been committed or where humans  have  been  assassinated  in  large  numbers,  such  as  the Coliseum in Rome, the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, the site of the former World Trade Center in New York, and the battlefields of wars past and present. Hundreds, thousands, tens of  thousands,  even  millions  of  psychotic  extraphysical consciousnesses who died in deeply traumatic circumstances may still be attached to places such as these. </p>
<p>•  Current and ex-torture chambers such as Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad in Iraq. </p>
<p>•    Former  prison  dungeons  (including  ruins)  such  as  the medieval Tower of London and the Conciergerie in Paris. </p>
<p><a id="p222"></a>•  Any hostile extraphysical district. </p>
<p>•  Other peoples’ bedrooms. Everyone has the right to absolute privacy in his bedroom. In some rare cases we might be taken to someone’s bedroom by a helper to carry out some assistance. This is OK as long as we are very discreet about anything we might learn there. </p>
<p><b>Beings</b></p>
<p>You  could  also  choose  a  physical  or  extraphysical  individual  as  the target  of  a  projection.  If  you  want  to  approach  someone  who  is physical  outside  the  body,  make  sure  the  person  is  willing  to participate and get his permission to do so first. Perhaps you would like  to  project  to  someone  you  know  who  is  sick  and  who  could benefit  from  your  energetic  assistance.  Or  you  could  aim  to  have  a joint  projection  with  a  partner,  family  member  or  friend,  so  your target  would  be  to  meet  them  outside  the  body  at  a  predetermined place and time. </p>
<p>Or  you  could  choose  an  extraphysical  being  as  your  target:  your helper or evolutionary orientor or maybe someone you know who has already passed away. </p>
<p><b>Beings who should not be approached</b></p>
<p>There are some physical individuals we should not approach when we are outside the body for fear of shocking and disturbing them while they  are  working,  should  they  perceive  us.  These  include  surgeons performing  an  operation,  machine  operators,  truck  drivers,  anyone riding a motorbike, barbers who are shaving someone with a razor or anyone else engaged in potentially dangerous work. </p>
<p>Extraphysical  consciousnesses  who  should  be  avoided  include anyone  who  has  recently  died  and  is  resting  and  recuperating  from the shock of losing the physical body. Particularly avoid anyone who has committed suicide, as they are often extremely disturbed and/or traumatized.  You  could  also  suffer  too  great  an  impact  from  seeing someone you know in such a condition. </p>
<p><b>Ideas</b></p>
<p>You could also have an idea as your target, such as a new hypothesis for  a  scientific  conundrum,  a  cure  for  a  disease,  or  a  solution  to  a, <a id="p223"></a>problem or issue you’re trying to resolve. Perhaps you would like to understand, for example:</p>
<p>•  how memory suppression works</p>
<p>•  how we can better recall our projections</p>
<p>•  the mechanisms that allow our emotions to take control over the mental body</p>
<p>•    the  differences  in  time  that  exist  between  the  physical dimension and the extraphysical dimension</p>
<p><b>Self-Target</b></p>
<p>A self-target is one in which your aim is to discover useful information about yourself. It might be something related to your physical body such  as  a  health  problem  that  could  be  investigated  through  the phenomenon  known  as  internal  extraphysical  autoscopy  (when  you are able to see inside your own physical body while projected); or it could  be  related  to  your  energy  body,  your  silver  cord  or  your extraphysical  body.  Perhaps  you  would  like  to  see  if  your extraphysical body is carrying any scars or traumas from former lives that  are  responsible  for  some  of  your  present  life  conditions,  for example. </p>
<p>As  part  of  the  projective  target  technique,  draw  up  a  projective agenda. Make a list of six targets selected from the categories above, name  them  and  order  them  according  to  their  degree  of  difficulty. </p>
<p>Assign a realistic deadline to achieve each target (e.g. three months, nine  months,  one  year)  based  on  the  fact  that  you  will  practice regularly, and adjust the deadlines as you go along, according to your results. </p>
<p><b>The Elongation of the Extraphysical Body Technique</b> Elongation or elasticity is a natural attribute of the extraphysical body and  shouldn’t  be  a  cause  for  concern  or  fear.  The  aim  of  this technique  is  to  stretch,  expand  and  loosen  the  extraphysical  body (particularly  the  para-arms  and  legs)  until  you  lose  the  reference points for your physical body. When this happens you will feel free of the  physical  body  as  your  extraphysical  body  will  be  partially disconnected,  and  you  can  allow  the  extraphysical  body  to  totally detach and float up. </p>
<p><a id="p224"></a>To apply the technique, first relax well. When you are settled and relaxed, think about your feet and start to accumulate your energies there. When you can feel the energies gathering in your feet, focus on your extraphysical body and concentrate on growing or elongating the para-feet.  Try  to  stretch  them  five  centimeters  beyond  the  physical feet.  When  you’ve  done  it,  return  to  normal  and  relax.  Repeat  the exercise  and  try  to  stretch  the  para-feet  out  five  centimeters  again. </p>
<p>Then return to normal and relax. Do it a third time, return to normal and relax again. </p>
<p>In the next  step,  concentrate  on  your  head  and  put  your  energies there.  Try  to  stretch  the  para-head  out  and  relax,  three  times,  each time as before. Go slowly. Take your time. </p>
<p>Start  the  whole  process  again  but  this  time  stretch  your  para-feet out ten centimeters each time, and your para-head out ten centimeters each time. </p>
<p>Repeat the process, this time stretching your para-feet out twenty centimeters  each  time  and  your  para-head  twenty  centimeters  each time. </p>
<p>Finally,  stretch  your  para-feet  out  half  a  meter  and  while maintaining this length with your feet, stretch your para-head out half a meter. Persist with this part of the exercise as long as you need until you achieve the result. </p>
<p>Then,  while  your  extraphysical  body  is  still  stretched  in  both directions,  imagine  yourself  expanding  like  a  balloon  through  the chest  and  torso  area.  When  you  start  to  feel  a  ballooning  sensation (another sensation commonly experienced during the take-off of the extraphysical  body—see  the  next  chapter),  your  extraphysical  body will be starting to detach, so at this point, shift your focus from the technique  to  the  target  that  you  had  selected  for  your  projection  to induce the full take-off of the consciousness in the extraphysical body. </p>
<p><b>Projection through the Mental Body Technique</b></p>
<p>If you would like to experience a projection in your isolated mental body  (cosmoconsciousness,  <i>nirvana,  satori,  samadhi</i>),  the  state  of enlightenment  against  which  all  other  spiritual  experiences  are compared, it is important to regularly work with the mental body by studying, learning and developing its attributes to keep it active and, <a id="p225"></a>flexible. Ideally, you should also have some experience with voluntary projections  in  the  extraphysical  body  before  attempting  a  mental projection. </p>
<p>You will have to choose a target  <i>idea</i> for this type of projection, as any  other  target  (such  as  a  place  or  a  person)  will  engage  your emotions and thus lead to a projection of the extraphysical body, the body of our emotions. </p>
<p>To attract the isolated mental body, your target idea should be an elevated  concept  or  enigmatic  question  that  can  be  developed  or considered from new perspectives that go beyond the boundaries of your maturity and knowledge in the ordinary, physical waking state. </p>
<p>Targets  for  a  projection  in  the  mental  body  are  notional  concepts that are outside the boundaries of ordinary life. The point of them is to  break  out  of  the  boundaries  of  what’s  known.  The  experience  is epitomized  by  having  an  epiphany—suddenly  you  consider  the concept  of  infinity  or  spirituality  or  oneness  and  you  have  an expansion of consciousness in which you grasp the whole idea. In a projection in the mental body you move into an arena that has more to do with understanding and awareness than form or function. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>•  If you are a cosmologist, you could think about the precise notion  or  concept  of  infinity  in  relation  to  the  vastness  of  the universe. </p>
<p>•  If you are a physicist you could think about possible means of transcending time. </p>
<p>•  In our case, we could try to find out how the consciousness began; how  we  manifested  before  we  began  the  multiexistential  cycle and what our level of evolution was; or we could try to find out if we  ever  discard  the  mental  body  and  if  so,  how  we  would manifest then; or we could try to discover something new about the mechanisms of group karma. </p>
<p>Once you have selected your target idea and established a deep state of  relaxation,  you  will  need  to  forget  the  following  three  things  as they will restrict your mind:</p>
<p>•  the world of forms: length, width and height (lines, curves, spheres etc.)</p>
<p><a id="p226"></a>•    the  world  of  space:  the  physical  dimension,  the paratropospherical dimension and the extraphysical dimension</p>
<p>•  the world of chronological time: the past, present and future (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years) Concentrate  now  on  your  target  and  be  open  to  original,  creative ideas. </p>
<p><b>The Extraphysical Self-Awakening Technique</b></p>
<p>If we consider that nearly all of us experience some level of separation between  our  physical  and  extraphysical  bodies  during  the  natural course of nightly sleep then a useful technique for producing a lucid projection is one that prompts us to increase our lucidity and “wake up” outside the body when we are already at least partially projected. </p>
<p>The extraphysical self-awakening technique is an effective  method for achieving this and it works like this. When you are in the normal waking state, saturate your mind with the idea and determination of extraphysically  awakening  yourself  anytime  something  happens  that suggests you are projected. For example:</p>
<p>•  you find yourself suspended in an empty space</p>
<p>•  you notice that you’re not breathing</p>
<p>•  you discover that you are emitting your own light</p>
<p>•  you perceive that an ordinary mirror doesn’t reflect you</p>
<p>•  you are able to confirm that nobody can hear you</p>
<p>•  you recognize that your vision is superior to physical vision Program yourself to think about this as often as you can, every day. </p>
<p>Wear a watch that alerts you on the hour for example, and spend a few moments concentrating on this idea every time the alarm sounds. </p>
<p>Immerse  yourself  in  this  technique  until  your  extraphysical  lucidity automatically increases any time you realize you are no longer in the physical dimension. (Vieira, 2002)</p>
