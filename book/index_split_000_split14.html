<p>Karma and the Multiexistential Cycle</p>
<p>Destiny is no matter of chance. It is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved. </p>
<p> <i>—Wil iam Jennings Bryan</i></p>
<p><b>The Alternation of Physical and Extraphysical Existences</b> Another  fundamental  principle  of  conscientiology  is  that  the consciousness  undergoes  a  series  of  successive  lives  in  which  it alternates  physical  lives  with  extraphysical  periods  spent  between lives.  This  process  is  more  popularly  known  as  reincarnation.  In conscientiology,  the  interval  between  lives  is  referred  to  as  the intermissive  period  or  intermission.  The  alternation  of  physical  and extraphysical existences is known as the multiexistential cycle. </p>
<p>The natural, basic state of the consciousness is extraphysical, with the periods spent inside the dense energy-matter vehicle of the human body being temporary phases that provide, as we will see in <a href="index_split_000_split18.html#p146">part  3, </a></p>
<p>unique opportunities to mature and evolve. Support for this claim is evident  in  the  fact  that  during  the  nightly  sleep  of  most  of  the advanced  life  forms  (i.e.  humans  and  animals),  the  consciousness returns  several  times,  usually  unconsciously,  to  the  extraphysical dimension  to  rest  and  restore  itself  in  its  more  natural  state. </p>
<p>(Alegretti, 2004)</p>
<p>When the consciousness is about to begin a new physical life, the extraphysical  body  approaches  the  physical  dimension  and  absorbs the  denser  energies  that  will  form  the  energy  body  (if  it  passed through  the  second  death  and  discarded  the  previous  energy  body). </p>
<p>The consciousness begins to establish an energetic connection with its new parents, particularly the mother—a connection that is fortified by the natural energies of the environment—and at the moment at which the mother’s egg is fertilized, the first connections of the silver cord connecting the consciousness to the developing fetus are established. </p>
<p>(Alegretti, 2004)</p>
<p><a id="p98"></a><img src="index-98_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p>An important point to understand about this process is that because the extraphysical and mental bodies of the consciousness accompany it throughout  its long  series of  lives  (as explained  in  <a href="index_split_000_split9.html#p29">chapter  1</a>)  the consciousness is able to perpetuate much of its personality from one life to the next, including some of the behaviors, skills, knowledge of subjects, capacities and attributes it has learned in previous lives. Just how much of its “innateness” a consciousness recovers as it matures through the new physical life depends on many factors, but mostly on the amount of awareness regarding its wider multiexistential reality it manages to retrieve, assuming of course that it had any to begin with. </p>
<p>In conscientiology, we study and research only the multiexistential cycle of the consciousness, which represents but a dot in the broader evolution  of  the  consciousness.  Although  we  don’t  know  what happened  prior  to  the  very  first  physical  manifestation  of  the consciousness, we do know that the series of successive physical lives will end at the point at which we pass through the third death (see <a href="index_split_000_split9.html#p29">chapter 1</a>). </p>
<p><b>The multiexistential cycle</b></p>
<p>This diagram shows the three states in which we exist during the multiexistential cycle: the physical state, the extraphysical state and the projected state (as occurs during an OBE). The more lucid OBEs we  have  and  recall,  and  the  more  we  learn  about  our  wider  reality from  these  experiences,  the  more  prepared  we  will  be  for  both  our intermissive  periods  and  the  time  when  we  will  permanently  be without a physical body. These learning experiences therefore play an important role in bridging the gap between the different dimensions and  in  bringing  us  closer  to  the  point  of  concluding  the multiexistential cycle. </p>
<p>So, answer these questions for yourself:</p>
<p> <i>What is my current level of awareness of my existential seriality? </i></p>
<p><a id="p99"></a> <i>What value do I ascribe to my existential seriality? </i></p>
<p>These questions truly merit some serious reflection, because when you  have  understanding  and  awareness  of  your  existential  seriality, you comprehend that you are much more than your current physical incarnation, which is just one life of many you have had and are yet to  have,  in  which  you  are  just  one  person  of  many  that  you  have already been and are yet to be. This realization is the first critical step towards  understanding  that  your  current  physical  life  is  not  an arbitrary, random existence but one of value, purpose and countless opportunities to evolve and to influence the nature and quality of the remainder of your multiexistential cycle. </p>
<p>Of course, this realization would be greatly facilitated if we could remember  anything  at  all  of  our  past  lives.  The  main  reasons  that most of us don’t, along with tips and techniques for being able to, are discussed in <a href="index_split_000_split17.html#p133">chapter 8</a>. </p>
<p><b>The Period between Lives</b></p>
<p>With regard to the period between lives, or the intermissive period, it is  a  common  fallacy  that  this  time  is  an  unconscious,  comatose existence  for  everyone.  As  we’ve  already  seen  in  previous  chapters, this  is  far  from  true.  Certainly  many  do  suffer  from  post-mortem parapsychosis  or  lead  simple,  unthinking,  robotized  existences. </p>
<p>Nevertheless,  a  small  percentage  of  consciousnesses  pursue  busy, productive, unselfish existences during the intermission that are full of opportunities  for  learning,  for  lending  assistance  to  others  and  for participating  in  the  preparation  of  the  next  physical  life.  And  of course,  as  is  true  in  the  physical  world,  every  permutation  and combination  of  the  human  condition  exists  between  these  two extremes. </p>
<p>Of  all  the  factors  that  affect  our  existential  seriality  and  how  it unfolds,  some  specifically  influence  the  nature  of  the  intermissive period of the individual, including the duration, which can last from a few  short  hours  up  to  several  centuries  in  some  rare  cases,  and  the extraphysical  location  in  which  a  consciousness  will  more permanently reside during this time. </p>
<p><b>Duration</b></p>
<p>It is thought that the duration of the intermissive period of an average <a id="p100"></a>human  consciousness  who  is  unremarkable  in  either  a  positive  or negative sense, is roughly the same as that of an average human life—</p>
<p>approximately  seventy  years.  There  are  some  notable  exceptions  to this.  Most  suicides  for  example,  are  reborn  shortly  after  the  act  so spend  very  brief  periods  between  lives.  Sometimes  they  are  reborn into the same extended family to allow them further opportunities to redress  any  karmic  imbalances  they  may  have  with  that  particular group of people. At the other end of the spectrum, when a person has planned  work  he  is  supposed  to  carry  out  in  a  physical  life,  the investment  required  in  the  intermissive  period  sometimes  becomes greater depending on the specific nature of the task planned, and the period  between  lives  can  become  longer.  For  example,  a  life  of advanced  human  leadership  at  times  demands  intensive,  lengthy preparation over several intermissive periods. </p>
<p><b>Extraphysical Hometown</b></p>
<p>The  key  factor  in  determining  the  characteristics  of  an  individual’s intermissive period however is whether or not he gains extraphysical lucidity,  i.e.  awareness  of  his  nonphysical  condition  after  death  and thus discards the dense energies of the energy body (second death). </p>
<p>The  majority  of  people  don’t  achieve  the  second  death,  while  some only manage to partially discard the energy body. In these cases, the extraphysical  body  remains  laden  with  varying  proportions  of  the energy  body,  and  a  filter  effect  comes  into  play,  restricting  these consciousness  from  accessing  certain  layers  of  the  extraphysical dimension  where  the  energies  are  considerably  more  subtle  and refined. </p>
<p>Within  the  range  of  extraphysical  layers  that  a  consciousness  can access between lives lies a kind of extraphysical hometown to which he will usually return at the end of each of his physical lives. </p>
<p>When we are between lives in the extraphysical dimension, we form cohesive  groups  with  other  nonphysical  consciousnesses  with  whom we have natural rapport in terms of our level of lucidity, our thoughts, ideas,  interests,  behaviors,  intentions,  habits,  ideologies  and  belief systems. Like always attracts like. These shared affinities have linked us  to  these  individuals  in  previous  lives;  therefore,  we  also  share  a history and have karmic links with this group. So we can be sure of a warm welcome from the members of our group when the time comes for us to return to our extraphysical origins. </p>
<p><a id="p101"></a>I encourage you to verify this information for yourself. One of the techniques  for  producing  lucid  out-of-body  experiences  described  in <a href="index_split_002_split8.html#p217">chapter  16  </a>is  the  mental  target  technique.  You  could  choose  your extraphysical hometown as your target, and try to pay a visit out of the  body  and  reacquaint  yourself  with  the  members  of  your  group who are currently between lives. </p>
<p>While a natural gravitation towards like-minded people is also an observable reality of physical life, the segregation between groups is much less stark than what is seen in the extraphysical dimension. To give  an  example,  individuals  who  are  completely  unaware  of  their nonphysical  condition  between  lives  do  not  coexist  with consciousnesses who are lucidly preparing for their next physical life. </p>
<p>In the physical dimension by contrast, individuals of widely varying capacities coexist side by side on a daily basis. It is entirely possible that a serial pedophile be seated on a train between a teenage punk and a conservative elderly woman. Consciousnesses don’t intermingle in  this  way  in  the  extraphysical  dimension.  This  is  a  feature  of  the physical  dimension  and  an  example  of  the  many  learning opportunities uniquely available to physical life. </p>
<p><b>Holokarma</b></p>
<p>Another  factor  that  significantly  influences  the  nature  of  our intermissive periods,  as well  as our  physical  lives, is  our  holokarma (from  the  Greek   <i>holos</i>  meaning  whole)  which  incorporates  our egokarma, groupkarma and polykarma. </p>
<p>For those not familiar with the concept, karma is the Sanskrit word for  “action”  or  “deed.”  Over  time,  the  meaning  of  the  word  has evolved to incorporate the effects or consequences of one’s actions. </p>
<p>While  numerous  groups  of  people  around  the  world  including various Shiite Moslem sects of western Asia, tribes of West Africa such as the Igbo of Nigeria, and the Tlingit of southeastern Alaska, do not link  one’s  karma  to  one’s  morality,  most  Westerners  who  believe  in reincarnation have come to adopt the more prevalent Hindu-Buddhist doctrine of karma, which is based on an appropriate punishment or retribution  for  a  causative  behavior  and  includes  the  possibility  of reincarnation in the animal bodies of less evolved species. (Stevenson, 2001)</p>
<p>According  to  these  religions,  karma  is  the  catalyst  that  drives  the <a id="p102"></a>multiexistential  cycle,  meaning  one’s  moral  conduct  in  one  life  will determine the circumstances of one’s future. Extrapolating this point backwards, so to speak, suffering is attributed to negative deeds of the past. </p>
<p>As we understand it in conscientiology, karma is the law of cause and effect or action and reaction. However, our understanding of the concept  deviates  from  the  Hindu-Buddhist  doctrine  on  the  issue  of punishment  and  reward  in  that  we  don’t  consider  a  person’s circumstances  or  experience  of  life,  for  better  or  worse,  to  be  a punishment or reward, but simply the harvest of seeds planted in the past.  Each  and  every  consciousness,  from  a  simple  single-celled amoeba to the most advanced extraphysical helper, is in the process of evolution and each of us is evolving upwards. This naturally precludes the possibility of being reborn in a less evolved state. You are largely responsible  for  creating  your  circumstances  for  yourself.  I  say "largely”  because  not  all  suffering,  disasters,  crimes  and  misfortune are  caused  by  karma.  I  cannot  put  a  finer  point  on  this.  There  are always  several  possible  explanations  for  any  given  situation  and  we should always be aware of this fact. Some situations that seem unfair may have been planned by a helper to give us an opportunity to learn a skill that we will require in a future life. Others might be unplanned accidents,  the  unfortunate  result  of  being  in  the  wrong  place  at  the wrong time, or the consequences of carelessness. </p>
<p>Equally,  not  all  karma  is  negative.  Think  of  the  karma  you  have with your helpers for example. </p>
<p> <i><b>Bearing  in  mind  that  we  are  multidimensional,  multiserial consciousnesses, the karmic consequences of our actions, decisions,  choices, thoughts, ethics and intentions are sometimes not apparent in  this  life,  but  only  reach  fruition  in  future  physical  lives  and intermissive periods, and determine to some degree the location and the amount of time spent in each dimension, the company we keep both physically and extraphysically, and the amount of freedom we experience, among other things. </b></i></p>
<p>How  this  actually  works  becomes  more  apparent  when  we understand  the  three  types  of  karma  that  collectively  make  up  our holokarma. </p>
<p><b>Egokarma</b></p>
<p><a id="p103"></a>Egokarma  is  a  personal  karmic  account  in  which  your  actions  and inactions have consequences only for you. For example, if you make some  efforts  to  improve  yourself,  to  perform  some  self-analysis,  to overcome your weak traits and strengthen and build upon your strong traits,  you  won’t  suffer  from  the  same  personal  limitations  in  your next life. This would be the karmic result of your actions. </p>
<p><b>Groupkarma</b></p>
<p>Groupkarma is the karmic account we have with the people who are closest  to  us,  with  the  people  we  know  or  have  known  more intimately in this life and previous lives, some of whom are currently extraphysical,  as  mentioned  earlier.  Groupkarma  is  unavoidable during our existence on earth because human beings depend on others to survive, notably up until the age of five. </p>
<p>For each of us, our karmic group is composed of everyone we have ever met and have had some level of relationship with (not including passing  acquaintances).  So  your  group  is  made  up  of  the consciousnesses  who  are,  or  who  have  been  in  previous  lives, members of your immediate and extended family, your friends, lovers, colleagues, teachers, students, team mates, neighbors and others with whom you are perhaps working on your personal development. </p>
<p>Because of the natural rapport, mutual affection, energetic affinities and past history we have with those in our group, the links we share become  stronger  and  more  established  over  many  lives,  creating  in turn some interesting synchronicities and increasing our chances of re-meeting  these  people  in  future  lives.  This  is  known,  in conscientiology,  as  groupkarmic  inseparability.  We  don’t  re-meet everyone  in  our  group  every  life  however.  Some  you  may  only reencounter once a millennium. </p>
<p>To give you an  idea  of  how  many  people  are  in  your  group,  it  is hypothesized  that  an  average  person  has  links  with  hundreds  of thousands  of  consciousnesses,  both  physical  and  extraphysical. </p>
<p>Bearing  in  mind  Vieira’s  approximation  that  there  are  up  to  nine extraphysical  consciousnesses  for  every  physical  consciousness,  we can conclude that we have many more extraphysical consciousnesses closely related to us than physical. The strength of the connections we have  to  various  individuals  in  our  group  varies.  Perhaps  several thousand years ago a particular person was a member of your family <a id="p104"></a>every life over a series of ten or more successive lives. So you were very involved with that person then, but if you haven’t met him or her in  three  thousand  years,  neither  during  your  physical  lives  nor intermissive  periods,  you  would  have  closer  ties  now  with  the individuals with whom you have shared more lives more recently. </p>
<p>We also have some level of karmic connection with a much wider group  that  consists  of  millions  of  physical  and  extraphysical consciousnesses. </p>
<p><b>The Stages of Groupkarma</b></p>
<p>The type of karma that has most bearing on the twists and turns of the multiexistential cycle is groupkarma. Bearing in mind that most of us have  probably  already  lived  many  hundreds  of  lives,  and  thinking back to the uncivilized condition of mankind thousands of years ago, it  is  logical  to  conclude  that  at  some  point  in  the  past  many  of  us would have engaged in group activities of one kind or another that we would not be so proud of today. Did we fight wars with our group, invading  other  countries  with  no  provocation  and  oppressing  the conquered people? Did we once sacrifice children to our gods or burn "witches” and sodomites at the stake? Were we once pirates or slave traders? We have all made mistakes in the past. None of us is perfect. </p>
<p>On this note, it is worth emphasizing again that we acquire karma through our inactions as well as our actions. To give an example, one of the gravest instances of group inaction of the last century was the failure  of  the  governments  of  many  first-world  countries  and  of various international bodies to intervene in the Rwandan Genocide of 1994  in  which  one  million  Tutsi  and  moderate  Hutu  victims  were murdered  by  extremist  Hutu  militia  in  one  hundred  days.  This genocide was planned. Intelligence to this effect was provided to the international  community  before  the  killings  began,  and  global  news coverage  reflecting  the  sheer  scale  of  the  atrocities  was  broadcast across  the  world  as  they  took  place.  And  no  one  intervened.  So certainly there are karmic consequences for groups of people who fail to act as a group when they should. But the responsibility for speaking out  against  and  preventing  war  crimes,  poverty,  disease  and  other crises  cannot  only  rest  with  governments.  We  also  have responsibilities  as  societies.  Did  you  know  that  30  million  people belonging  to  the  global  society  put  their  names  on  the  LIVE  8  list which was presented to Tony Blair as chair of the G8 Summit in 2005, </p>
<p><a id="p105"></a>to  campaign  against  poverty,  and  that  three  billion  people  watched the  LIVE  8  concert  that  year?  Such  is  the  pressure  that  we,  as societies, can exert on the politicians of our time to act. </p>
<p>The  karma  we  create  with  our  group,  whether  it  is  through  our actions or inactions, is not so easily settled or cleared. Even the more moderate, benign cases demand at least seven-and-a-half centuries of physical lives and effort, on average, to progress through the various stages that culminate in the settling of the account one has with one’s group  (for  want  of  a  better  expression)  and  the  liberation  of  the consciousness  from  its  groupkarma.  This  figure  represents  the minimum time. It would take someone responsible for mass genocide, for example, considerably longer to be free of his groupkarma. Let’s take a look at how this process unfolds. </p>
<p><b>Interprison</b></p>
<p>Sometimes there are situations in which a person cannot get out of his group because if he tries to escape, he will be killed. A situation like this  can  even  persist  over  several  lives.  Some  groups  involved  in unethical, criminal activities such as “extermination” groups involved in  ethnic  cleansing,  mafias,  terrorists,  prostitution  rings,  drug networks and organizations involved in human trafficking and forced labor  subscribe  to  such  codes  of  behavior  as  a  means  of  controlling and entrapping weaker or more vulnerable individuals. In cases like these,  the  condition  is  not  just  one  of  natural  groupkarmic inseparability but one of  <i>interprison</i>, in which the individual is trapped because he has profited from the unethical activities of the group. In this first stage of the groupkarma, the person is very well adapted to his group. He is in his element in fact. He is 100 percent comfortable and  settled  with  his  companions  and  has  no  moral  dilemma  or internal conflict about the group’s activities. To the contrary, he has absolute certainty about what he’s doing and brooks no criticism. This radical,  extremist  and  less  mature  behavior  represents  the  very beginning of group development. </p>
<p><b>Victimization</b></p>
<p>But as per the law of karma, every action has a consequence. So when someone involved in a group like this eventually starts to question the group’s  <i>raison d’être</i> and the prudence of his own engagement there, and finally manages to break free (perhaps after several lives), he will <a id="p106"></a>become a victim in a later life of the same antisocial organization he helped  to  create.  Several  lives  spent  in  this  phase  of  retribution  or <i>victimization</i>  may  be  required  in  order  to  settle  one’s  group  karmic account. Put simply, if you make a mess, you have to clean it up. </p>
<p>Contrary to the rather simplistic popular understanding of how this aspect  of  karma  unfolds,  there  are  countless  ways,  simple  and complex,  direct  and  indirect,  subtle  and  obvious,  in  which  a  person can be a victim of his own group. </p>
<p>For  example,  a  drug  trafficker  responsible  for  peddling  heroin  or cocaine  in  one  life  might  suffer  indirectly  as  a  result  of  drugs  in  a future  life  due  to  his  karma.  He  may,  as  an  innocent  passer-by  and through an apparent synchronicity, be the victim of a street crime or other drug-related violence and get hurt or killed. A son or daughter of  his  might  become  a  drug  addict  in  a  future  life.  Or  he  might experiment  with  intravenous  drugs  once  only,  in  a  future  life,  and contract the HIV virus. </p>
<p>Or let’s say a woman runs her own prostitution business. As part of her karma she may find herself poor, uneducated and lacking in skills in a future life, with five children to support and no husband. So she could find herself in a situation in which her only means of earning a living and supporting her family is to become a prostitute. Or, perhaps she resides next to a busy brothel and is tormented day and night by the  extraphysical  intruders  of  the  prostitutes  and  their  clients, oblivious to the real cause of her stress. If she is more lucid, she might work with a charity or NGO that gives support to women who want to stop prostituting themselves, but she might have a hard life working like  a  donkey  and  being  persecuted  by  the  people  who  run  the business—not pleasant, but a more constructive type of victimization nonetheless. </p>
<p>So there are many different ways in which a person can rebalance his karmic account. </p>
<p><b>Reconstruction</b></p>
<p>The period of victimization will eventually end and the individual will then  enter  a  phase  in  which  he  begins  to  have  enough  lucidity  and balance to help his former victims, members of his group whose lives he destroyed who are still stuck in the interprison and victimization phases.  This  stage  represents  the   <i>reconstruction</i>  of  the  holokarmic <a id="p107"></a>account.  For  example,  perhaps  someone  was  a  chronic,  abusive alcoholic in one life and caused his family much pain and distress. In a later life, when the victimization phase has come to an end, he may work  in  a  field  in  which  he  counsels  and  helps  people  to  overcome their  addictions,  or  as  a  benefactor  of  an  organization  that  offers assistance and support to abused people. </p>
<p><b>Freedom</b></p>
<p>After spending some time reconstructing his groupkarma, maybe more than one life, a person will become liberated from his negative karmic links.  The  person  starts  to  experience  real   <i>freedom</i>  for  the  first  time and a quality of life that is characterized by a greater level of control over his present and future circumstances. He has choices and options open to him that he didn’t have before and is not suffering from so much intrusion anymore. Someone who is at liberty to choose his area of education, perhaps pursue a career in another field altogether, who has the wherewithal and resources to live in many different countries, and  leads  a  life  filled  with  opportunities  for  personal  growth  and contact  with  others,  would  at  least  be  in  this  phase  of  the groupkarma.  Someone  who  struggles  on  a  daily  basis  to  fulfill  the basic  requirements  necessary  for  survival  does  not  experience  this level of freedom. </p>
<p><b>Polykarma</b></p>
<p>The  final  phase  of  groupkarma  (and  the  third  type  of  karma  that makes  up  one’s  holokarma)  is  when  a  person  applies  himself  to developing his mental body. He dedicates himself to self-knowledge, to improving and evolving as a consciousness, and to assisting large numbers of others to do the same, including people he doesn’t know. </p>
<p>This  is   <i>polykarma. </i>  At  this  level,  the  person  doesn’t  ask  anything  for himself anymore; he has a universalistic outlook on life, consciously applies  his  discernment,  maturity  and  cosmoethics  (see  <a href="index_split_002_split4.html#p195">chapter  13)</a></p>
<p>and is working towards becoming free of intrusion. </p>
<p>Leaders  such  as  Mahatma  Gandhi  and  Nelson  Mandela  acted  on their  polykarmic  accounts  with  positive  actions  that  alleviated  the suffering  and  improved  the  lives  of  many  thousands  of  people, dismantling  and  incapacitating  well-established  mechanisms  of physical and extraphysical intrusion in the process. Terrorists such as Osama  bin  Laden  and  rogue  leaders  such  as  Saddam  Hussein, <a id="p108"></a>Slobodan  Milosevic  and  Adolf  Hitler,  added  negative  polykarma  to their karmic accounts, each playing the role of the physical focal point of a larger multidimensional mechanism of intrusion. </p>
<p>Karma is always multidimensional in nature, meaning there are also extraphysical  consequences  or  repercussions  to  one’s  actions.  The multidimensional implications of polykarma are greater than those of egokarma and groupkarma, and address more complex issues such as evolution. </p>
<p>Every  person  has  his  egokarmic  and  groupkarmic  accounts  open from the moment he takes his first breath on earth but only a small minority of people will open their polykarmic account. </p><p>
</p><p class="calibre5">* * *</p>
The frequency of the rebirth of the consciousness and the duration of the  intermissive  periods  depend  for  many  hundreds  of  years  on  its personal  egokarma  and  the  karmic  debts  of  its  group.  Additional aspects related to groupkarma that can affect our existential seriality include the existential seriality of those who are or have been blood relatives, and the level of individuality of a consciousness, as usually a consciousness lacking in individuality is governed by his groupkarma. <p></p>
<p>These factors can have some bearing on where and to whom we are reborn. </p>
<p>When  we  begin  to  understand  the  dynamics  and  mechanisms  of holokarma, we can start thinking about what practical steps we can take to improve our own and in so doing can exercise more control over our future lives and periods between our lives. For example, on the  egokarmic  level,  look  after  yourself  well  by  ensuring  that  all  of your  physical,  emotional  and  mental  needs  are  met  without  being selfish or egocentric. To improve your groupkarma, strive to have a clear conscience with regards to all of your relationships. Take steps to  eliminate  any  misunderstandings  and  resentments  with  frankness and  sincerity  and  avoid  causing  sadness  or  pain.  Don’t  victimize others and don’t play the victim. To activate your polykarmic account, do good works of assistance to help not only your friends and family, but strangers—people that you don’t know—and as many of them as possible. </p>
