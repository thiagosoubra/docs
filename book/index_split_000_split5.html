<p><a id="p12"></a>Foreword</p>
<p>Throughout the course of his life, Brazilian consciousness researcher, Waldo Vieira MD, has amassed one of the largest existing libraries on the out-of-body experience (OBE) and is considered one of the most prolific  “lucid  projectors”  alive,  reportedly  producing  intentional OBEs on an almost daily basis. Far from being a guru-type personality, Vieira states that producing lucid OBEs is a natural human ability that everyone  can  develop.  He  also  insists  that  you  doubt  and  question everything he says; that you have your own experiences of the OBE and other altered states of consciousness instead to verify his claims. </p>
<p>Vieira has written a number of books including the acclaimed diary of personal experiences  <i>Projections of the Consciousness</i> and a thousand-page  tome  entitled   <i>Projectiology</i>,  which  attracted  the  attention  of  a number  of  science-oriented  individuals  who  were  dissatisfied  with both  materialistic  and  religious  approaches  to  understanding consciousness. </p>
<p>The  current  views  on  the  relationship  between  the  brain  and consciousness held by most physicians, philosophers and psychologists are too narrow to explain the near-death experience (NDE), which is similar  in  nature  to  the  OBE  and  considered  by  Vieira  as  a  specific type of OBE. Both the OBE and NDE reveal that our consciousness (i.e. our  ability  to  be  aware)  does  not  always  coincide  with  brain functions;  that  we  can  in  fact  experience  our  consciousness independently of the physical body. </p>
<p>It is my pleasure therefore to introduce this book by Sandie Gustus, OBE  scholar  and  practitioner,  who  has  been  volunteering  with organizations associated with Vieira’s work since 2003. </p>
<p>Although a fellow physician who similarly questioned conventional theories about consciousness, Vieira’s path has been quite different to mine. I was a resident in 1969, working on a cardiac ward, when a heart-attack patient told me that while unconscious he had seen the most beautiful world, with extraordinary music and light. What I still can’t forget is the way he described the experience and how deeply impressed he was by what had happened. At the time I wasn’t at all, <a id="p13"></a>interested in consciousness. But I then read  <i>Return from Tomorrow</i>, a book  by  George  Ritchie,  who  as  a  medical  student  had  had  a  near-death experience. After reading this book I started to ask those of my patients who had survived a cardiac arrest if they had any memory of the period of unconsciousness. And to my enormous surprise, within two  years,  I  had  collected  12  personal  accounts  of  an  enhanced consciousness  during  the  period  of  clinical  death  in  50  survivors  of cardiac arrest. Because of this finding I decided to initiate, along with some  colleagues,  a  systematic  and  prospective  trial  into  this phenomenon  of  the  so-called  near-death  experience.  The  results, published  in   <i>The  Lancet</i>  in  2001,  demonstrated  that  common hypotheses  that  dismiss  the  NDE  as  a  real  event,  such  as  lack  of oxygen  to  the  brain  and  fear  of  death,  had  no  correlation  to  the occurrence  of  an  NDE.  Since  2003,  I  have  dedicated  myself  to researching the NDE phenomenon further, because it challenges our current  concepts  about  the  relationship  between  consciousness  and the function of our brain. </p>
<p>As for Vieira, he began experiencing out-of-body experiences at the age  of  nine.  He  grew  up  in  Minas  Gerais,  Brazil  and  was  heavily influenced  by  a  kind  of  religion  known  as  Spiritism  that  took  the philosophy  and  psychical  study  of  Frenchmen  Allan  Kardec  and attempted  to  merge  it  with  Christianity.  Vieira  eventually  left Spiritism to develop a more scientific approach that was not linked to any particular culture or faith but was instead based on a combination of scientific principles and direct, personal experience. This, of course, flew in the face of conventional scientific rules and expectations! How replicable  are  these  experiences?  How  can  we  reach  objective conclusions  using  subjective  experience?  Vieira  suggests  that  the corroboration  of  different  individual’s  accounts  of  remote  physical occurrences, and even shared OBEs, indicate an objective dimension to the OBE and its potential as a tool for the reliable exploration of consciousness beyond the physical body, for scientists and lay people alike. </p>
<p>Sandie Gustus provides a fascinating, detailed and highly readable overview  of  the  bases  of  this  scientific  and  spiritual  paradigm conceived by Vieira; now further developed by a number of scholars worldwide who combine personal exploration of nonphysical realms with  more  conventional  third-person,  objective  research  to  reach rational,  personally  verifiable  conclusions  about  the  nature  of, <a id="p14"></a>consciousness and the human condition beyond the physical body. </p>
<p>Bearing  in  mind  that  there  are  plausible  hypotheses  for  the  OBE that do not necessarily require extraordinary models, as I explain in <i>Consciousness Beyond Life</i>,  I  cannot  help  but  be  intrigued  by  Vieira’s experiences and theories. Perhaps Vieira is right but you and I won’t have cause to abandon the more conventional, physical explanations unless  we  have  our  own,  repeated,  out-of-body  experiences;  a consistent theme of this book and one that is supported by numerous techniques  for  controlling  one’s  energy,  developing  one’s  psychic abilities,  and  producing  OBEs  and  other  phenomena  at  will  …</p>
<p>techniques that Gustus insists can produce results for anyone who has the  determination  to  succeed.  One  thing  rings  true,  however.  While Vieira  and  I  present  different  approaches  to  the  study  of consciousness,  it  is  not  so  unlikely  that  the  two  will  be  equally important  to  answer  the  stubborn  questions  of  consciousness,  the brain and beyond. </p>
<p>If, like me, you have not had a lucid out-of-body experience, I invite you to enjoy this compelling book that credibly argues the case for life beyond the physical body with an open mind. </p>
