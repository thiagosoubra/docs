<p>The Bodies of Manifestation of the Consciousness</p>
<p>Just  as  the  dweller  in  his  body  passes  through  childhood,  youth, and old age, so at death he merely passes into another body. The wise are not deceived by that. </p>
<p> <i>—Sri Krishna</i></p>
<p>One of the most fundamental principles of conscientiology is that the consciousness,  being  composed  of  neither  energy  nor  matter,  is  not limited by form, space or time and is therefore able to present itself (or  manifest)  not  only  in  the  physical  world  but  in  more  subtle dimensions that  lie beyond  what we  can  perceive with  our  physical senses. </p>
<p>In  total,  the  consciousness  uses  one  of  four  different  bodies  (or vehicles) recognized by conscientiology to manifest; namely:</p>
<p>•  the physical body in the physical dimension</p>
<p>•    the  energy  body  (which,  although  unable  to  house  the consciousness  as  such,  enables  us  to  affect  or  alter  our manifestation)</p>
<p>•  the astral body in nonphysical dimensions</p>
<p>•  the mental body in the mental dimension</p>
<p>Although  the  word  “astral”  is  a  popular  term  that  most  people  can easily relate to, I’m going to use the word “extraphysical” instead of astral, as a synonym of nonphysical, in order to avoid suggesting any mystical or religious connotations. </p>
<p>Each  body  or  vehicle  of  the  consciousness  adapts  to  and corresponds  to  the  specific  properties  of  the  dimension  in  which  it manifests  and  each  one  presents  particular  attributes  of  the consciousness. </p>
<p>Understanding that the consciousness is multidimensional is crucial to  enabling  a  complete  picture  of  the  reality  of  human  existence  to <a id="p30"></a>emerge. So let’s consider in more detail what being multidimensional means and how this really works. </p>
<p><b>The Physical Body</b></p>
<p>In  order  for  the  consciousness  to  exist  in  and  interact  with  the energetically  dense  physical  environment,  it  uses  a  body  made  of energy  and  matter  …  the  physical  body.  The  physical  body  is perfectly adapted to the physical dimension in that it can process the resources it requires for survival such as food, water and air, and has numerous  automatic  psycho-physiological  responses  that  further enhance  its  chances  of  survival.  But  while  our  physical  existence preoccupies  us  a  great  deal,  if  we  stop  for  a  moment  to  examine ourselves more closely, we see that there are clues liberally scattered throughout  our  ordinary,  everyday  lives  to  the  idea  that  we  are consciousnesses,  not  just  physical  bodies.  For  example,  the  way  we sometimes  think  and  feel  can  be  driven  by  experiences  such  as emotions,  mental  insights  and  energetic  connections,  none  of  which are  physical,  none  of  which  we  can  see,  touch,  map,  measure  or quantify. </p>
<p><b>The Energy Body</b></p>
<p>The consciousness also has an energy body that is roughly the same shape as the physical body only slightly larger. The part of the energy body that visibly extends beyond the physical body is known as the human aura. </p>
<p>The energy body is not a vehicle of the consciousness per se, but an interface between the physical body and the extraphysical body. </p>
<p>When  the  physical  and  extraphysical  bodies  are  in  a  state  of nonalignment such as occurs during a projection, part of the energy body  forms  what  is  commonly  known  as  the  silver  cord.  The  silver cord  connects  and  secures  the  consciousness  to  the  physical  body when it is projected into other dimensions. </p>
<p><a id="p31"></a><img src="index-31_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p><b>The part of the energy body that visibly extends beyond the physical body is known as the human aura</b></p>
<p>Although  the  energy  body  is  not  officially  recognized  by conventional medicine, it has long been acknowledged by traditional Chinese medicine and is a vital component of several complementary therapies  such  as  acupuncture,  acupressure,  homeopathy,  Reiki  and shiatsu  massage.  Interestingly,  the  British  Medical  Association,  who used  to  call  complementary  treatments  “alternative,”  as  they  were considered  to  represent  an  alternative  to  conventional  medicine, changed the term to “complementary” in recent years as, increasingly, medical  doctors  and  complementary  therapists  began  working together  using  treatments  that  they  both  recognized  to  be  of  value. </p>
<p>(Lewith, 2002). This suggests that the allopathic medical community has  taken  a  small  but  significant  step  towards  acknowledging  the <a id="p32"></a>energy body and the important role it plays in healing. </p>
<p><b>Characteristics of the Energy Body</b></p>
<p>Known in conscientiology as the holochakra, and also known as the aura  or  etheric  double,  the  energy  body  is  not  static  but  constantly absorbs,  metabolizes  and  externalizes  energies  in  a  process  of exchange  with  other  living  beings  and  with  the  natural  energies produced by the environment—the air, water, earth, plants, food and the universe. </p>
<p>This  process  of  energetic  exchange  sustains  the  energy  body.  It  is also  responsible  for  the  energetic  replenishment  and  balance  of  the physical  body  and,  as  such,  the  sustenance  of  human  life.  Mostly  it takes place while we are asleep and slightly projected out of the body, which also explains why we feel refreshed after a good night’s rest. </p>
<p>This exchange of energy mainly takes place via numerous energetic vortexes within the energy body, known as chakras. Conscientiology recognizes ten main chakras (the sole chakras, the root or sex chakra, the  spleen  chakra,  the  umbilico-chakra,  the  palm  chakras,  the  heart chakra,  the  throat  chakra,  the  frontal  chakra  [third  eye],  the  nucal chakra  [back  of  the  neck]  and  the  crown  chakra),  most  of  which correspond to physical organs. The millions of microchakras, links and channels that actually circulate the energies and connect the chakras to their counterparts in the extraphysical body are known as nadis, or in acupuncture, meridians. </p>
<p><b>The Extraphysical Body</b></p>
<p>The extraphysical body (known in conscientiology as the psychosoma, but  also  as  the  astral  body,  emotional  body,  astral  double,  human double, spiritual body and subtle body, among many other terms) is the vehicle used by the consciousness to manifest in the multilayered extraphysical dimension. The extraphysical dimension is where most people find themselves during an out-of-body experience. This is also where we go when we die. Many people have reported encountering loved ones who have already passed away during a projection in the extraphysical dimension. This is more commonly experienced during a near-death experience (NDE, a kind of forced OBE). Such experiences can  be  very  powerful,  as  they  allow  personal  verification  of  our immortality. </p>
<p><a id="p33"></a>According  to  Vieira’s  extensive  personal  experimentation  and research,  which  is  corroborated  by  the  results  of  numerous  other researches  (such  as  the  online  OBE  Survey  conducted  by  IAC researchers  Nanci  Trivellato  and  Wagner  Alegretti,  to  which  over 10,000  participants  have  responded),  due  to  the  subtlety  of  the energies of extraphysical dimensions, the consciousness is significantly less limited in the extraphysical body than it is in the physical body and  because  of  this,  presents  characteristics  that  are  remarkably different. </p>
<p><b>Characteristics of the Extraphysical Body</b></p>
<p>As there is no air in most extraphysical dimensions, the extraphysical body isn’t burdened by the incessant need to breathe. This can be a little frightening for those who suddenly find themselves lucid outside the body for the first time and realize they are not breathing. (Note: if there is any interruption in the breathing of the  <i>physical</i> body during a projection however, the projection automatically terminates). But not needing  to  breathe  outside  the  body  can  trigger  an  unrivalled, euphoric sense of freedom. </p>
<p>One of the people interviewed by Raymond Moody in  <i>Life After Life</i> described the intensity of the euphoria he experienced during an NDE as follows:</p>
<p>“Life  is  like  imprisonment.  In  this  state,  we  just  can’t  understand what prisons these bodies are. Death is such a release—like an escape from  prison.  That’s  the  best  thing  I  can  think  of  to  compare  it  to.” </p>
<p>(from   <i>Life  After  Life</i>  by  Raymond  Moody,  published  by  Rider. </p>
<p>Reprinted by permission of the Random House Group Ltd.) Similarly,  when  manifesting  in  the  most  subtle  extraphysical dimensions  where  there  is  no  gravity,  the  extraphysical  body  is  not bound to the earth’s crust, so can think about a place and instantly transport  itself  there  in  an  amount  of  time  equivalent  to  some seconds. </p>
<p>Other  characteristics  of  the  extraphysical  body  include indestructibility; weightlessness; 360-degree vision and the capacity to pass  through  material  objects,  emit  light,  communicate  more efficiently using telepathy and change its appearance or be invisible. </p>
<p>However,  these  skills  are  not  inherent  and  may  have  to  be  learned when  projected.  Usually  the  extraphysical  body  takes  on  the  same <a id="p34"></a>appearance as the current or most recent physical body because most people have a strong attachment to the present or most recent human form. </p>
<p>You  may  also  have  to  learn  how  to  defend  yourself  in  the extraphysical  dimension  or  how  to  help  consciousnesses  in  need through the transmission of your energies. Don’t just assume that you are able to do all these things when projected. But if you can’t, take heart. These skills can be acquired if you have the will to learn. </p>
<p>Assuming  you  are  lucid  as  to  your  condition  outside  of  the  body, your  capacity  to  associate  ideas;  process  information;  remember things;  apply  your  will  and  use  your  rationality,  decision-making abilities  and  critical  analysis  is  often  heightened  because  you’re  not restricted  by  the  limitations  of  the  physical  brain.  But  lucid individuals  who  are  adept  at  controlling  the  extraphysical  body, navigating the extraphysical dimension and carrying out preplanned extraphysical tasks and objectives represent only a small minority of the human population. These skills have to be learned. </p>
<p>As  I  mentioned  in  the  introduction,  although  every  human  being experiences some separation between their physical and extraphysical bodies several times a night while asleep, the vast majority do so with either low levels of lucidity or no lucidity at all. Statistics arising from international opinion polls and surveys suggest that approximately 10 percent  of  the  population  has  semi-conscious  OBEs  that  are  usually mixed  with  dreams,  while  approximately  80  million  people, representing 1.2 percent of the population, have lucid, fully conscious OBEs. </p>
<p>In addition, there is an intrinsic difference in the way we experience emotions in the physical and extraphysical bodies. Emotions are more pronounced and we feel them more keenly in the extraphysical body because there is no physical shield to protect us from the impact of the intentions, ideas, thoughts and feelings of others. In the physical dimension  by  contrast,  people  often  mask  their  true  thoughts  and intentions behind their words and expressions for the very purpose of avoiding conflict and emotional repercussions. </p>
<p>A friend of mine once had a projection that demonstrates very well the  difference  in  how  we  can  experience  our  emotions  in  the extraphysical dimension. He was projected with a reasonable level of lucidity when suddenly he perceived some pressure from behind. He <a id="p35"></a>turned  around  and  noticed,  in  the  far  distance,  an  extraphysical individual  looking  at  him  intently.  The  impact  of  the  stranger’s attention  completely  unbalanced  him  and  he  tore  off,  fearful  and anxious, before being snapped back into the body. What is interesting to  note  here  is  the  contrast  between  this  behavior  and  a  likely reaction to a similar event in the physical body. As he said himself, if he’d been walking down the street in the physical dimension, sensed someone  staring  at  him  from  behind,  and  turned  around  to  see someone  looking  at  him  from  the  other  end  of  the  street,  it  would have been entirely inconsequential. </p>
<p>An  out-of-body  experience  is  not,  however,  an  inherently destabilizing process. And of course the level of emotional stability we experience  outside  of  the  body  is  also  in  part  a  function  of  our personal level of maturity, openness and wisdom. </p>
<p><b>The Mental Body</b></p>
<p>In terms of density, the mental body (or mentalsoma), which hosts the consciousness during an OBE in the purely mental dimension, is the most  subtle  body  of  manifestation.  During  a  mental  projection,  the consciousness acts in an isolated manner without the human body, the extraphysical  body  or  the  silver  cord  but  is  secured  to  the extraphysical body via a formless connection called the golden cord. </p>
<p>Probably the most important thing to understand about the mental body  is  that  the  consciousness  resides  here.  Because  of  this,  the mental body is the seat of our awareness and the core of who we are. </p>
<p>Let me explain more precisely what I mean by this. </p>
<p>When  we  are  in  the  physical  dimension,  we  are  restrained  by certain limitations. For example, we are subject to gravity, we have to sleep,  eat,  drink  and  breathe  in  order  to  survive.  Our  memory  is incomplete.  We  don’t  remember  all  the  details  of  our  dreams,  we remember little of our experiences outside of the body and most of us remember nothing about our past lives. </p>
<p>As  we  have  already  seen,  when  we  manifest  in  the  extraphysical body, either projected or between lives, we are much freer and more advanced  than  we  are  in  the  physical  dimension  in  the  way  we capture  and  process  information,  communicate  with  others,  move about, interact with our environment, see and remember things. </p>
<p><a id="p36"></a>If we can do all of those things with the extraphysical body, can you imagine  how  much  more  we  can  do  with  the  mental  body  when everything we’ve ever learned, everything we know and the memory and  wisdom  gained  from  everything  we’ve  ever  experienced  in previous lives is accumulated there? </p>
<p>In this state of absolute freedom from the restrictions imposed by the  more  energetically  dense  dimensions,  the  mental  body  is  much more  refined  and  complex,  is  able  to  realize  many  more  of  the consciousness’s  potentialities  and  is  therefore  in  a  condition  that  is significantly closer to the core of who it really is. For this reason, it is understood that the mental body is the seat of one’s awareness. </p>
<p><b>Characteristics of the Mental Body</b></p>
<p>The characteristics and attributes of the mental body lie well beyond the  model  for  existence  widely  accepted  by  conventional  science.  A unique  attribute  of  the  mental  body,  for  example,  is  the  complete memory of the existence of the consciousness, as mentioned above. So when  manifesting  in  the  mental  body,  the  consciousness  is  able  to access all the details and information pertaining to its past lives and periods  spent  between  lives,  including  all  the  skills  and  knowledge about different subjects that it acquired, all the relationships it had, the countries in which it resided, languages it spoke, decisions it took, mistakes it made and so on. Those who have experienced a projection to  the  mental  dimension  will  tell  you  that  this  information  doesn’t even have to be recalled or accessed as such. It is just there, imprinted in the complete memory of the consciousness. </p>
<p>In terms of characteristics, the energies of the mental dimension are so subtle that no shapes can be formed there, so when projected in the mental body the consciousness is completely formless and cannot be detected  by  the  human  sensory  organs  or  by  regular  extrasensory perceptions.  The  mental  body  has  no  gender  or  sexual  impulse.  It expresses  refined  sentiments  such  as  serenity,  universality  and fraternity instead of the courser emotions typical of the extraphysical body.  And  it  is  known  to  transcend  the  human  notions  of  time  and space, so long periods spent in the mental body can strangely occur in the equivalent of mere minutes passed in the physical dimension. </p>
<p>The mental body is also the source of all the positive attributes that will help us to become aware of our broader multidimensional reality <a id="p37"></a>and to understand how, why and where we fit into it. These attributes include  self-awareness,  many  different  forms  of  intelligence, concentration  and  attention,  memory,  wisdom,  logic,  rationality, discernment,  lucidity,  self-organization,  self-control,  objective criticism, ethics and will, among many others. In truth though, only a minute percentage of the human population is using these attributes for the purpose of developing and evolving themselves. Most modern societies  are  motivated  instead  by  financial  gain,  prestige,  status, comfort and gratification and have very little awareness of or interest in realities that lie beyond the material world. </p>
<p><b>Pathologies of the Mental Body</b></p>
<p>If we can have attributes of the mental body, it stands to reason that we can also have pathologies of the mental body, a pathology being any deviation from a normal healthy condition. </p>
<p>Robotization,  a  condition  in  which  we  allow  ourselves  to  be controlled  by  mental  routines  and  fixed  ideas  all  the  time  is  one example  of  this.  Some  people  are  robotized  to  the  point  that  they barely use their mental body at all, such as those who blithely watch hours of TV every day, absorbing and accepting everything they see with no discernment. </p>
<p>Any  limitation  we  have  that  blocks  our  progress,  growth  and evolution as a consciousness can be considered to be a pathology of the  mental  body.  We  can  overcome  such  limitations,  however, through “personal renovation.” We each have established patterns of behavior  and  responses  to  given  circumstances  based  on,  in  some instances,  lives  of  repetitive  experience.  Self-renovation  requires recognition of improved ways of viewing the world around us and of engaging  with  it,  and  the  formation  of  new  responses  that  will gradually supersede existing, more harmful ones. So the mental body is  like  software.  If  we  are  going  to  evolve  we  have  to  constantly update  it,  assimilate  new  ideas,  confront  and  eliminate  our weaknesses,  and  develop  techniques  that  will  help  us  to  change. </p>
<p>Experiences such as lucid OBEs that enable us to verify for ourselves that our reality is multidimensional and that there is life after death, often bring significant change and reprioritization to people’s lives. </p>
<p><a id="p38"></a><img src="index-38_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p><b>The vehicles of manifestation</b></p>
<p>When a person is alive in the physical sense, his or her vehicles of manifestation are arranged as shown in this image. But what happens when we die? </p>
<p><b>What Happens When We Die? </b></p>
<p>At  the  moment  of  physical  death  (the  first  death),  the  silver  cord, which  is  responsible  for  maintaining  the  connection  between  the physical body and the extraphysical body, ruptures. Part of the energy body  remains  with  the  extraphysical  body  until  such  time  as  the individual  becomes  aware  that  he  is  no  longer  alive  in  the  physical sense … in other words, that he has died. </p>
<p>When this realization occurs, the energy body is discarded (second death) and the individual returns to the original, natural condition of an  extraphysical  consciousness.  It  can  take  hundreds  of  lives  to develop this level of multidimensional awareness however. The reality is that the majority of people who are unprepared for life after death <a id="p39"></a>do not completely discard the energy body. </p>
<p>Once  a  person  has  passed  through  the  second  death,  only  the extraphysical  and  mental  bodies  remain.  These  two  bodies  continue the  cycle  of  new  physical  lives  and  periods  spent  between  lives, joining with a new physical body and passing through physical death hundreds of times over many thousands of years. </p>
<p>But  the  more  knowledge  and  awareness  we  have  of  the multidimensional  nature  of  our  existence,  the  more  we  experience things that most people think are just fiction, such as producing lucid OBEs  at  will,  perceiving  and  communicating  with  extraphysical individuals  and  controlling  some  psychic  and  energetic  phenomena. </p>
<p>As  we  accomplish  these  things,  we  advance  our  mental  body.  We expand its capacity, lucidity and level of understanding. At the same time  we  become  less  emotional  because  the  logic,  rationality  and more  refined  sentiments  of  the  mental  body  start  to  dominate  the emotional tendencies of our extraphysical body. As our emotionality decreases, the extraphysical body becomes more and more subtle until we reach a point where it no longer serves a purpose and we discard it (the third death). At this point the consciousness will exist only in the mental body and won’t return to the cycle of physical life. </p>
<p><b>Everyday Experiences of Your Vehicles of Manifestation</b> In the introduction I spoke about the importance in conscientiology of having  your  own  experiences.  So  here  are  some  examples  of experiences you may have already had that confirm the existence of your extraphysical and mental bodies. </p>
<p>Have you ever dreamt that you were falling from a great height and then jerked awake, heart pounding? Sometimes, of course, this really is  a  dream.  As  already  mentioned  though,  most  people  experience some  level  of  separation  between  the  physical  and  extraphysical bodies at night while they’re asleep. If the extraphysical body is not just floating above the physical body but is some distance away and for  any  one  of  many  possible  reasons  the  silver  cord  pulls  it  back suddenly,  usually  you  will  return  at  a  great  speed.  When  the extraphysical  body  reenters  the  physical  body  very  suddenly,  the "impact”  of  the  landing  can  cause  us  to  jerk  awake.  I  think  most people have had this experience. </p>
<p>Another example that you may have experienced is a phenomenon <a id="p40"></a>known as sleep paralysis (or more technically, projective catalepsy). </p>
<p>As  explained  in  an  article  written  by  my  colleague  Nanci  Trivellato and myself, this is the phenomenon that occurs either at the onset of sleep or as you are starting to wake up, where you become aware at a moment in which your physical and extraphysical bodies are not fully aligned.  You  feel  yourself  to  be  inside  the  body,  but  due  to  the nonalignment  of  the  two  bodies  of  manifestation  the  physical  brain doesn’t  respond  to  your  commands.  In  such  instances  the  paralysis experienced is the sensation of being unable to move, not an actual incapacity to do so, so there is nothing to fear. </p>
<p>To fully realign the extraphysical body with the physical body, just relax  and  focus  on  making  a  small  movement,  such  as  taking  in  a deeper breath and expanding your lungs or moving a toe or a finger, and the sensation of paralysis will disappear. </p>
<p>As we mention in the article, “the ideal means by which to control projective  catalepsy  and  a  range  of  psychic  phenomena  associated with dreaming and the OBE is to be able to master your own subtle energies,  also  known  as  bioenergy,  <i>chi</i>  or   <i>prana. </i>”  (Trivellato  and Gustus,  2003)  Bioenergy  and  techniques  for  controlling  it  are discussed in depth in <a href="index_split_000_split12.html#p78">chapter 4</a>. </p>
<p>History  has  recorded  many  incidences  of  man  manifesting  in  his mental body during a mental projection of the consciousness. Other terms  used  to  describe  the  projection  of  the  mental  body  include cosmic  consciousness,  <i>nirvana</i>  (Buddhism),  <i>satori</i>  (Zen),  <i>samadhi</i> (yoga), ecstasy (mystics) and exaltation (mediumship). </p>
<p>As a concept, the projection of the mental body is incomprehensible to  those  who  have  never  had  the  experience  and  it  can  only  be properly  understood  by  those  who  have.  Even  so,  many  who  have enjoyed  the  experience  find  words  quite  inadequate  to  describe  this state  of  being,  as  it’s  so  far  removed  from  our  understanding  of reality. </p>
<p>Waldo  Vieira  provides  the  following  insights  into  his  personal experience of the phenomenon in  <i>Projections of the Consciousness:</i> There,  in  that  nonexistent  place,  nothing  existed,  but  everything was  existing.  I  experienced  ‘touchable’  ideas,  unshakable certainties, indescribably serenity and undreamed of well-being. </p>
<p>Even  with  my  experience  of  automatic  writing,  channeling, </p>
<p><a id="p41"></a>clairvoyance, precognition, physical effects and many hundreds and various types of projections, I have experienced nothing in this life that compares to the wonders of the “sightless vision” and “emotion of  structural  peace”  that  was  “seen”  and  “felt”  in  this  fully conscious projection using the mentalsoma. (Vieira, 1997) Those  who  are  able  to  achieve  a  full,  lucid  projection  with  their mental body may also experience cosmoconsciousness, an intangible, somewhat  indescribable  state  of  expanded  awareness,  of  all-knowingness,  that  allows  a  global  view  in  which  the  entirety  of  all things is perceived, understood and appreciated as a single whole. The experience,  in  which  the  consciousness  transcends  space,  time  and form, is commonly reported as promoting a profound sense of peace and harmony with everyone and everything. </p>
<p>William  Bulhman,  author  of  several  books  on  the  OBE,  quotes  a participant of his international survey in  <i>The Secret of the Soul</i>,  who gave the following account of just such an experience: My  awareness  was  stretched  across  the  universe.  Words  cannot describe any of this, for I was far beyond form and substance. I was suddenly in an incredible ocean of pure living light. Everything was there—all knowledge, all awareness, and all answers. I was part of it  all.  I  didn’t  ever  want  to  leave.  (Robert  J.,  York  Beach,  Maine. </p>
<p> <i>The  Secret  of  the  Soul</i>,  William  Bulhman,  2001,  HarperCollins Publishers)</p>
<p>Cosmoconsciousness  has  been  studied  by  many  of  the  world’s traditional  and  nontraditional  religions  and  is  the  benchmark  of enlightenment  against  which  all  other  spiritual  experiences  are measured. It is worth pointing out here that although the experience eclipses  even  the  most  elevated  state  of  awareness  available  to  the consciousness  manifesting  in  the  human  form,  it  is  not  a  mystical event.  I  define  a  mystical  event  as  one  that  literally  cannot  be explained. But I appreciate that many people use the word “mystical" to describe any experience that occurs beyond normal physical reality. </p>
<p> <i><b>The reference points that shape our understanding of existence are generally based upon cultural influences; education; beliefs systems;  the  dogmas  of  most  religions  and  the  subjectivity,  conditionings, assumptions, limitations, fears and misunderstandings inherent to all of  these  factors.
