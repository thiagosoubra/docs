<p><a id="p78"></a> <i>Chapter Four</i></p>
<p>Bioenergy</p>
<p>No man is free who is not master of himself. </p>
<p> <i>—Epictetus</i></p>
<p>In  the  previous  chapter,  we  started  to  look  how  our  thoughts  and feelings  modulate  the  quality  and  orientation  of  our  energies,  and how  the  quality  of  our  energies  in  turn,  determines  who  we  have around  us  both  physically  and  extraphysically.  In  other  words,  we only connect with energies that have an element of similarity to ours. </p>
<p>So  we  can  see  that  energy  plays  a  key  role  in  the  transdimensional interactions  and  relationships  we  have  with  both  physical  and nonphysical beings. </p>
<p>In this chapter we’re going to take a closer look at the properties and characteristics of energy, further examine the fundamental role it plays  in  our  multidimensional  existence,  and  learn  how  we  can improve our energetic sensitivity, capacities and self-defense. </p>
<p><b>Bioenergy—A Look Back through History</b></p>
<p>In conscientiology, the term  <i>bioenergy</i> is used to describe the basis of the  individual  energetic  field  that  emanates  from  and  encompasses every living being. </p>
<p>Although bioenergy can’t be detected using the physical senses, its existence  has  been  recognized  by  almost  every  spiritual  tradition. </p>
<p>Authors John White (who with astronaut Edgar Mitchell founded The Institute  of  Noetic  Science)  and  Stanley  Krippner  claimed  in   <i>Future Science:  Life  Energies  and  the  Physics  of  Paranormal  Phenomena</i>  that references  are  made  to  the  human  energy  fields  or  the  aura  of  the body in 97 different cultures. (White and Krippner, 1977) Synonyms  commonly  used  to  describe  this  type  of  energy  include <i>qi/chi</i>  (China),  <i>prana</i>  (India),  subtle  energy,  vital  energy,  vital  fluid (Spiritism),  universal  life  energy  (Rei-Ki),  astral  energy  and  cosmic energy. There are many others. (Vieira, 2002)</p>
<p><a id="p79"></a>As far back as 5,000 years ago, bioenergy was acknowledged by the spiritual  tradition  of  India  as  the  universal  source  of  all  life.  They called it  <i>prana</i>. It was the yogis who proposed the system of chakras and  nadis  as  points  throughout  the  energy  body  (etheric  double) through  which  energy  is  exchanged  between  the  extraphysical  body and the physical body. These are also the channels through which we absorb  energy  from  and  send  energy  out  (exteriorize)  to  the environment.  Both  of  these  processes  are  necessary  for  the maintenance  of  our  energy  levels  and  the  sustenance  of  vitality, health, longevity and indeed, life itself. </p>
<p>Practitioners  of  Qigong  discovered  numerous  related  benefits  of reaching  a  certain  level  of  proficiency  or  mastery  of  their   <i>chi</i>, including  improved  psychic  abilities  such  as  telepathy  and clairvoyance and a generally heightened (psychic) awareness of what was going on around them extraphysically on a moment to moment basis.  These  consequences  were  found,  in  turn,  to  promote  overall spiritual healing and maturation. </p>
<p>According to  <i>The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions</i>, all religions have  a  more  or  less  holistic  view  of  healing,  placing  it  within  the broader context of life and acknowledging the close relationship that it  has  with  the  “psychosomatic  unit  of  the  human  entity,”  ( <i>Bowker</i>, 1997) which includes the energy body. </p>
<p>Many  scientists  have  attempted  to  invent  equipment  for  detecting and recording bioenergy. Kirlian photography, discovered by accident by  Russian  Semyon  Kirlian  in  1939,  applies  a  high-voltage  electric field to an object placed on a photographic plate, producing an image of  the  signals  emitted  which  is  said  to  represent  the  object’s bioenergetic  field.  (Trivellato  and  Gustus,  2003)  A  more  recent development  is  the  PIP  (Polycontrast  Interference  Photography) scanner devised by British scientist Harry Oldfield. This system uses a digital video camera and a computer program to analyze the way in which a person’s bioenergetic field interacts with light and to generate a moving image of the person’s aura. </p>
<p>Among  other  experiments  performed  by  scientists  in  this  field, many noteworthy investigations, such as the research into the Human Energy  Field  (HEF)  conducted  by  Dr.  Victor  Inyushin  at  Kazakh University  in  Russia  (Alvino,  1996)  have  confirmed  a  relationship between the balance of one’s energy field and good health. Research <a id="p80"></a>into parapsychic phenomena has also demonstrated that bioenergy is an intrinsic component of numerous phenomena such as the bending of  metal  at  will,  moving  an  object  without  touching  it, dematerializations  and  rematerializations,  ectoplasmy  (when bioenergy condenses in order to manifest in a compound condition in the  substance  called  ectoplasm)  (Vieira,  2002),  homeopathy, poltergeist  activities,  teleportation,  telepathy  and  psychic  surgery. </p>
<p>(Trivellato and Gustus, 2003)</p>
<p> <i><b>Despite  such  consistent  acknowledgment  throughout  history  by different cultures, religions and fields of science, bioenergy is, in the main,  an  inconspicuous  element  of  the  modern-day  materialistic western world, an element of which very few people have any direct,  consciousness  awareness,  making  the  following  quote  by  Winston Churchill seem particularly apt: “Man will occasionally stumble over the  truth,  but  usually  manages  to  pick  himself  up,  walk  over  or around it, and carry on.” </b></i></p>
<p>Whether we are aware of it or not, bioenergy plays a pivotal role in the daily lives of all ordinary folk as well as the more energetically sensitive. Here is how it works. </p>
<p><b>Bioenergy—Properties and Characteristics</b></p>
<p>Much  of  the  content  of  this  section  is  drawn  from  an  article  I coauthored  with  Nanci  Trivellato  entitled  “Bioenergy:  A  Vital Component  of  Human  Existence,”  first  published  in   <i>Paradigm  Shift</i> magazine in 2003. </p>
<p>Your bioenergetic field is a part of you that is in a constant state of flux;  adapting,  reacting,  changing,  responding  and  exchanging energies, via the chakras and nadis, with other living beings and with the environment. </p>
<p>In and of itself, bioenergy is neutral. In the case of human beings however,  it  never  exists  in  isolation  but  is  inextricably  linked  to  a person’s  thoughts  (be  they  conscious,  subconscious  or  unconscious) and emotions. So if someone’s personal bioenergetic field is positive, this is because the factors that drive his thoughts and feelings, such as his ideas, intentions, ethics, interests and objectives, are positive. All of  this  information  about  him  is  carried  in  his  energies.  Equally,  of course,  negative  thoughts  and  feelings  produce  negative  energies. </p>
<p>Simply  put,  the  quality  of  a  person’s  energies  is  determined  by  the <a id="p81"></a>quality of his thoughts and emotions. </p>
<p>As  it  is  true  to  say  that  very  few  people  are  in  a  condition  of complete self-awareness, very few of us totally control the quality of our energetic field. As stated in the article mentioned earlier, “As our energetic field is open, flexible and ‘porous’ then unless we have good awareness and control of our energies, we are subject to the influence of the energies of the people and environments around us. Conversely, regardless  of  our  level  of  awareness,  we  also  affect,  to  varying degrees, the energetic fields of the people and places we encounter in our  everyday  lives.”  (Trivellato  and  Gustus,  2003)  An  example  that illustrates these processes with which many of us will be familiar is when  our  physical,  psychological  or  mental  disposition  shifts  as  a result of coming into contact with another person. (ibid, 2003) Does the mere fact of being in the same room as a particular person make your scalp burn, your motivation soar or your rationality diminish, for example? </p>
<p>This also explains why we can instinctively feel a sense of rapport or familiarity with people who share our outlook on life but may feel uneasy, irritable or even unwell around people with whom we have nothing in common. Another example of an unconscious reaction to the  bioenergies  of  others  occurs  when  we  couple  energetically  with someone  we  are  spending  time  with  so  strongly  that  we  assimilate their emotions or physical ailments and begin to experience whatever they are feeling, e.g. calmness, euphoria, grief, depression, or even a physical  pain  such  as  a  headache.  (ibid,  2003)  Energetic  coupling occurs  when  the  bioenergetic  fields  of  two  people  overlap  and interfuse, as is shown in this image. </p>
<p><a id="p82"></a><img src="index-82_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p><b>We can assimilate the disposition of those around us via the process of energetic coupling. </b></p>
<p>In the same way that the quality of people’s energies varies, the way in  which  people  exchange  energy  with  others  and  with  the environment also varies. When we feel well within ourselves, relaxed, confident and inclined towards others, our energies are usually more open and flow more intensely and readily. On the other hand, when we repress our emotions or stew over things such as when we have a broken  heart,  feel  that  someone  has  done  us  wrong  or  can’t  forgive ourselves  a  mistake,  our  energies  can  become  blocked.  Many complementary  medicines  not  only  acknowledge  the  effect  that energetic blockages can have on our physical well-being but also the relationship  between  the  location  of  the  blockage  and  the  specific nature  of  the  illness.  For  example,  failing  to  “speak  up”  and  voice your  true  thoughts  for  fear  of  what  people  will  think  of  you  might cause  a  blockage  in  the  laryngo-chakra  (throat  chakra)  after  some time, which may eventually lead to a thyroid problem; failing to deal with  the  cause  of  a  stress  that  makes  your  stomach  knot  might eventually lead to a blockage in the umbilico-chakra which can cause digestive  disorders  such  as  hypochloridia  (low  stomach  acid),  leaky stomach, stomach ulcers or stomach cancer. </p>
<p><b>The Subtle Influence and Powerful Effects of</b></p>
<p><b>Bioenergetic Fields</b></p>
<p><a id="p83"></a>We have seen how a person’s presence and energetic field can affect or  influence  another  on  a  personal  level.  But  the  same  process  can also  take  place  on  a  much  larger  scale.  When  you  have  a  group  of people whose thoughts, emotions and energies are aligned, the force of  the  group’s  influence  can  be  sufficient  to  change  the  way  others think, feel or behave. This can happen in ways that are obvious or in ways  that  are  so  subtle  we  may  not  be  completely  aware  of  what’s happening. Sometimes when people say, “I got carried away,” or, “I got caught up in the moment,” they are referring to this process. </p>
<p>Author  and  healer  William  Bloom  provides  a  compelling  example that illustrates just how powerful the effects of mass energies can be in his book  <i>Feeling Safe. </i> He writes:</p>
<p>Throughout  the  world,  you  can  see  individuals  and  groups  of people  suddenly  caught  up  in  a  mass  movement  and  behaving  in ways that they never thought possible. Perhaps you remember the photographs of the Rwandan women with machetes  and  knives—</p>
<p>including mothers, professionals and highly educated women—on a rampage to kill and maim members of another ethnic group. There is,  of  course,  a  mass  field  of  energy  that  contains  violence  and aggression.  In  this  case,  these  normally  benevolent  women  were overwhelmed by the energies of the herd instinct and carried along into psychopathic behavior. (Bloom, 2002)</p>
<p>Violent  hooliganism  at  football  games  provides  another  example  of this process. The bigotry common to hooliganism usually begins with a  few  pockets  of  radical  individuals.  Their  fanatical  thoughts,  based around separating the crowd of supporters into those who are “with" them and those who are not, are combined with emotions fueled by hostility and antagonism. In the same way that a chant or a “wave" can  be  picked  up  and  imitated  by  tens  of  thousands  of  people  at  a football  game,  energies  carrying  the  thoughts,  emotions  and intentions  of  hooligans  can  also  pass  across  a  crowd  in  a  type  of bioenergetic contagion, touching those who have some affinity with the ideas and gaining in intensity as they join in. The tension of this type of energetic field builds like a pressure cooker until it takes just one punch to ignite a dangerous riot. </p>
<p>A bioenergetic field doesn’t only relate to individuals or groups of people.  It  can  also  define  the  characteristics  of  a  specific  place. </p>
<p>Consider some of the upscale department stores along Oxford Street in <a id="p84"></a>London  for  example.  Almost  every  day  of  the  year,  every  year, hundreds of women pile in and shop frenetically for the latest clothes. </p>
<p>The music is upbeat, the shop assistants are all looking cool in their branded gear, the shoppers’ thoughts are focused on their appearance and thousands of dollars of transactions are taking place every hour. </p>
<p>Reinforced  on  a  daily  basis,  the  energies  in  these  stores  are  loaded with  a  heady  mix  of  fun,  flirtation,  excitement,  sexuality,  anxiety, one-upmanship,  euphoria  and  the  addictive  sense  of  bountiful abundance  that  some  people  get  from  “retail  therapy”  when fulfillment is lacking in other areas of their lives. Try spending half an hour in such a store and coming out without being at least tempted to buy something and you may be able to observe a subtle influence at play. </p>
<p>The  bioenergetic  field  of  a  specific  place  can  just  as  easily  cast influence  on  a  much  larger  scale.  The  undeniable  power  of  the collective  energies  of  an  entire  country  was  very  well  portrayed  in Michael Moore’s film  <i>Bowling for Columbine. </i> The film, which won the 2003 Oscar for best documentary, explores America’s obsession with guns  and  shows  how,  over  many  decades,  American  politicians  and the media have bred a culture of fear and paranoia of violent crime among  Americans.  The  objects  of  the  fear  and  paranoia  are  mostly African  Americans  and  Arabs  and  for  the  most  part,  Americans genuinely  believe  themselves  to  be  at  risk.  To  defend  themselves against  the  apparent  ever-present  threat  they  support  laws  that facilitate the procurement of guns and ammunition, ironically giving rise  to  much  of  the  violence  and  crime  they  fear.  The  following staggering  statistics  demonstrate  just  how  influential  a  bioenergetic field can be when people allow themselves to be caught up in it on a mass scale:</p>
<p>•  Approximately 30,000 Americans die from gun violence every year. Of these, around 1,250 result from unintentional shootings. </p>
<p>(Coalition to Stop Gun Violence)</p>
<p>•  The rate of firearm deaths among children under the age of 15 is almost 12 times higher in the United States than in 25 other industrialized  countries  combined.  (Centers  for  Disease  Control and Prevention)</p>
<p>•  American children are 16 times more likely to be murdered with a gun, 11 times more likely to commit suicide with a gun, and <a id="p85"></a>nine  times  more  likely  to  die  from  a  firearm  accident  than children in 25 other industrialized countries combined. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)</p>
<p>Without knowing, Michael Moore actually refers to bioenergetic fields when  he  compares  the  vastly  different  incidences  of  gun  deaths despite  comparable  levels  of  gun  ownership  in  US/Canadian  border towns separated only by a river. Likewise, he questions if the shooting at  Columbine  High  School  in  Denver,  Colorado,  could  have  been influenced  or  predisposed  in  any  way  by  the  fact  that  the  biggest weapons facility in the US is located at the nearby town of Littleton. </p>
<p>Can  a  bioenergetic  field  extend  even  beyond  the  borders  of  a country? Yes. Think of the energies in the regions in Asia affected by the  Boxing  Day  tsunamis  of  2004.  A  series  of  horrors  involving hundreds of thousands of people all occurred in the same region at the same time; tidal waves, floods, shipwrecks, train pile-ups, landslides, cave-ins, building collapses and fires. The energies of these areas are likely  to  be  laden  with  the  emotional  terror  of  those  who  died;  the fear, confusion, loss and grief of those who survived and the immense suffering  caused  by  the  hunger,  thirst,  lack  of  shelter,  disease  and crime that followed the disaster. </p>
<p>Such natural catastrophes, as well as man-made acts of terror, have a profound impact on the human environments affected. The trauma becomes  integrated  into  the  living  memory  of  the  disaster  zones, affecting  those  who  live  or  pass  through  there  in  a  variety  of  both obvious and subtle ways. </p>
<p>Continuing on up the scale, the quality (or lack thereof) of certain bioenergetic fields can even characterize an entire continent. Anyone who has lived in Africa, for example, will know  that  the  overriding thoughts  and  intentions  of  the  inhabitants  of  many  of  the  African nations have been shaped by their long history of fighting for survival in  the  face  of  drought,  famine,  deadly  diseases,  civil  war  and genocide.  History  has  produced  a  continental  bioenergetic  field charged with a dog-eat-dog mentality that seemingly feeds off itself—</p>
<p>one  in  which  corruption,  violence  and  crime  have  become  the  very fabric of everyday life. </p>
<p>So  these  are  different  examples  of  how  a  bioenergetic  field produced  by  a  particular  group  of  people  or  inherent  to  a  specific place  can  influence  or  affect  us  in  some  way.  In  conscientiology,  a <a id="p86"></a>new  term  was  created  to  describe  such  a  bioenergetic  field  …</p>
<p> <i>holothosene</i> …  <i>holos</i> from the Greek meaning whole and  <i>thosene</i> from combining the  <i>tho</i> from thought, the  <i>sen</i> from sentiment (or emotion) and the  <i>e</i> from energy. </p>
<p>Dr.  Rupert  Sheldrake,  revolutionary  biologist  and  director  of  the Perrott-Warrick  project  for  research  on  unexplained  human  abilities funded  by  Trinity  College,  Cambridge,  presents  a  similar  vision  of what he calls a “a living, developing universe with its own inherent memory” via his theory of Morphic Fields and Morphic Resonance. </p>
<p><b>Energetic Sensitivity, Awareness and Control</b></p>
<p>It is important for us to ascertain if we have enough mastery of our own energies and thoughts not to be carried along by the collective energies  present  in  certain  groups  of  people  or  places.  Are  we independent  in  our  thinking?  Do  we  question,  analyze,  apply  our critical judgment and discernment to what we see on TV, read in the press  and  hear  on  the  radio?  Do  we  allow  our  thinking  to  be influenced by the predominant group mentality? </p>
<p>People  who  are  sensitive  to  energies  will  perceive  certain bioenergetic  fields  in  different  ways.  They  may  experience  the emotions  with  which  the  environment  is  impregnated.  For  example, they may enter a funeral home and feel a sense of loss, an  abattoir and  experience  terror,  a  prison  and  feel  a  sense  of  degradation. </p>
<p>Alternatively, they may feel nauseated, light-headed or have stomach cramps depending on the intensity of the bioenergetic field and their level of sensitivity to it. (Trivellato and Gustus, 2003) The bioenergetic field of specific places can also affect us positively. </p>
<p>We may, for example, feel more compelled to study or research and find  we  can  do  so  with  greater  ease  and  concentration  in  a  library than  at  home.  People  often  expect  that  the  renewed  enthusiasm  for intellectual  pursuits  that  they  get  when  visiting  an  inspiring  place such as a library will last, but are nonetheless unable to maintain the motivation  when  they  return  to  the  well-established  bioenergetic fields generated by the routines and distractions of their daily lives. </p>
<p>If people are able to perceive the effects of bioenergetic fields and have some control over their own energies however, they can actively maintain  their  energetic  equilibrium  and  be  untainted  by  pervading influences, all the while remaining aware of the quality and nature of <a id="p87"></a>the energies of the environments around them. </p>
<p>Most people though, do not have enough sensitivity or awareness to be able to “read” the bioenergies specific to a crowd or a particular place so  are either  unaffected  or unaware  of how  they  are  affected. </p>
<p>They  may  just  suddenly  feel  inspired,  moody,  joyous,  irritable  or drained for example (depending on the quality of the field), but have no idea why. </p>
<p>As  stated  in  the  article,  sometimes  “subtle  maladies  that  have  no apparent  cause  are  the  result  of  exactly  these  types  of  intrusions  of energies that are not compatible with ours, into our own energy field via one of our chakras.” (ibid 2003)</p>
<p><b>Exercises for Improving Energetic Sensitivity, Capacities and Self-Defense</b></p>
<p>The good news is that it is within the capacity of all of us to learn to become aware of and to assess the quality of our energies, to control them, and to perform self-diagnosis and therapy when necessary. </p>
<p>With  practice,  it  is  also  within  our  capacity  to  attain  a  level  of mastery  of  our  bioenergies  that  will  enable  us  to  increase  our extrasensory perceptions to the point where we can read the positive or  negative  energies  of  a  particular  environment  and  perceive, interact and communicate with our nonphysical companions, be they helpers, blind guides or intruders. The importance of developing such a level of perception cannot be underestimated. This is the first, vital step that will enable us to identify the strong traits and fissures in our personality that allow the helpers and intruders to connect to us. Then we need to strengthen the connections we have with the helpers and take  action  against  the  countless  varieties  of  intrusions  that  we regularly experience. In so doing, we assume a much greater level of responsibility for and control over our lives. </p>
<p>Vieira devised and recommends three energetic exercises that, with regular practice and training, can help us to develop and/or improve our control of and sensitivity to bioenergy. </p>
<p>Before describing these, I would like to emphasize that bioenergy is a powerful resource, that  <i>real y</i> exists, and that moving energies is a very real endeavour. No amount of visualization or imagination will ever be sufficient to perform any of these exercises, so I’m not going <a id="p88"></a>to  instruct  you  to  employ  these  methods.  The  key  to  success  in working  with  energies  is  to  remain  physically  relaxed,  to  block  any interference from the external environment and to actively focus on moving bioenergy through the application of your ironclad will. Most people  unfamiliar  with  working  with  energies  have  little  or  no perception of the movement of energy at first. But the mere attempt usually produces some small results, even if you are unaware of them, so  don’t  give  up,  persist.  Regular  practice  will  bring  improved, tangible results in almost all cases. </p>
<p><b>Absorption of Energies</b></p>
<p> <i>Definition:</i> The act of absorbing or interiorizing energies <i>Comments:</i></p>
<p>Perform this exercise in a place where you know the energies to be positive. The ideal would be to do it in a natural environment as the energies of nature do not carry any information (in terms of thoughts or emotions), so go to a place like a park or garden, forest, mountain, ocean or river if you can. </p>
<p><b>How do I do it? </b></p>
<p>Relax in any way you would normally, breathe normally, and using your will and concentration, try to become aware of the energies of the environment around you. Try to tune into them, to sense them, to perceive  how  positive  they  are  and  how  good  they  make  you  feel. </p>
<p>Now  turn  your  attention  to  absorbing  this  positive  energy  through your chakras. It might take some practice before you start to become aware of the sensations that accompany this action and will confirm that you are actually moving energy, so don’t be discouraged if this is your case. Persevere. </p>
<p>Often  the  temptation  in  the  beginning  is  to  absorb  energy  as  you inhale. Try in time to establish a rhythm that is independent of the rate of respiration. The reason for this is because you don’t want to become dependent upon being able to breathe at a certain rate, or on anything else for that matter, in order to be able to absorb energy. </p>
<p><b>How does it feel? </b></p>
<p>Common  sensations  include  a  change  in  temperature  (e.g.  feeling warmer or colder), energetic “shivers” that sweep through part of or <a id="p89"></a>your whole body or a tingling sensation. Some people may experience clairvoyance (i.e. perceptions of the extraphysical dimension). </p>
<p><b>What are the benefits? </b></p>
<p>The  main  reason  to  absorb  energy  is  to  replenish  your  reserves  of energy  and  invigorate  your  bioenergetic  field  if  you  are  feeling energetically depleted or drained. Symptoms of this with which we’re all familiar are tiredness, lethargy, lack of motivation and heaviness. </p>
<p><b>Conscious Donation (Exteriorization) of Energies</b> <i>Definition:</i> the transmission of energy</p>
<p> <i>Comments:</i></p>
<p>Before exteriorizing energies, check your thoughts and emotions. If you  are  preoccupied  or  not  in  a  good  condition,  wait  until  your thoughts are balanced and your emotions are positive so as you add only positive energy to your surrounds or the environment. </p>
<p><b>How do I do it? </b></p>
<p>Relax and focus your attention on what you are about to do. Perhaps, at  first,  until  you  become  accustomed  to  moving  your  energy,  you could focus on accumulating energy in your hands. As our hands are very sense oriented and we are used to “doing” things with our hands, it’s often easier to perceive energy moving through them. So think of accumulating energy in your hands and then use your will to do it. </p>
<p>When you can sense your energy there, concentrate on flowing it out through your palm chakras. Experience has shown it’s easier to move a larger volume of energy by exteriorizing in regular pulses or waves rather than in a continuous flow, so try to do this also. Once you have mastered this, practice exteriorizing energy through your whole body, through all of your chakras simultaneously. </p>
<p><b>How does it feel? </b></p>
<p>The  sensations  are  the  same  as  when  we  absorb  energy—feeling warmer  or  colder,  energetic  “shivers,”  tingling,  the  possibility  of clairvoyance, etc. </p>
<p><b>What are the benefits? </b></p>
<p>When we exteriorize energy that is infused with positive thoughts and <a id="p90"></a>emotions we perform a kind of energetic cleansing that improves the energetic quality of the environment around us. </p>
<p>Bioenergy is also a powerful resource for assisting others in both the physical and extraphysical dimensions, including animals and plants. </p>
<p>Assistance can either be offered through the direct transferal of energy to  the  person/animal/plant  in  need,  or  it  can  be  donated  to  the helpers who then use it to help others (with their consent of course). </p>
<p>Direct  energy  transferal  could  be  used,  for  example,  to  calm someone who is emotionally distraught or has suffered a trauma, to alleviate or prevent some physical ailments, to inject life into a dying plant  or  to  settle  a  pet  before  the  dreaded  visit  to  the  vet.  In  the extraphysical dimension, bioenergy can be used by projectors to calm and  capture  the  attention  of  disorientated,  recently  deceased individuals,  or  to  treat  extraphysical  consciousnesses  who  can manifest every variety of illness and pathology that we see here in the physical dimension, and more besides. </p>
<p>I had an interesting experience a few years back in which I donated bioenergy  to  the  helpers  who  then  used  it  to  help  my  cat  who  had gone missing. She had come to live with us as an adult cat only two months  previously  and  had  obviously  decided  it  was  time  to  go  off exploring beyond her new territory and had got herself lost. I went to bed  during  her  second  night  away  concerned,  as  it  was  a  typical winter’s night in London—raining hard, biting wind and bitterly cold — so  I  explained  to  the  helpers  that  little  Scragglepuss  has  good perceptions  of  the  extraphysical  dimension  (something  I  knew  from previous  experiences  with  her),  so  if  they  had  the  time,  could  they please try to get her attention and guide her home, and that they were welcome to avail themselves of as much of my energy as they needed for the task. I lay quietly in bed and consciously donated energy for well over an hour, checking regularly that it was still flowing and that I felt well and balanced. Eventually I had an intuition to stop so I got up, it was 2:00 a.m. I switched the lights on in the conservatory and the back garden, sat down to write an email, and five minutes later the little fur ball appeared through the cat flap, unhurt but famished and  clearly  well-pleased  to  be  home.  Happy  days.  Thanks  to  the helpers. </p>
<p>Another  benefit  of  exteriorizing  energy  is  to  use  it  as  a  means  of "fixing”  your  day.  It  is  good  practice,  at  the  end  of  every  day,  to <a id="p91"></a>analyze what happened during the day and ask yourself “Who did I disturb? Who did I neglect to help? Who did I not want to help?” And then  send  the  best  energies  you  have  to  those  people  as  a  way  of balancing your relationships and your day. </p>
<p>Exteriorizing energy also acts as a safe-guard against intrusion. You can safe-guard your bedroom, your home or your office, for example, by exteriorizing energy to perform an energetic cleansing for five to ten minutes on a daily basis. In time, this will create an energetic field that  acts  like  a  protective  shield.  It  makes  sense  doesn’t  it—if  you exteriorize  energy  when  you  are  well  and  positive  every  day, eventually you will establish a strong energetic environment in your home that the intruders have no affinity with. This will prevent them from entering into your home. Do not however, exteriorize energies at the  same  time  every  day  while  you  are  working  to  establish  the energetic shield. Remember in the last chapter I described how most intruders  are  not  able  to  absorb  the  thin  energy  of  the paratroposphere and so intrude on humans to take from us the energy that they need? If we exteriorize energy in the same place at the same time every day we attract their attention, so vary the time as much as you can. Once the field is established, you can exteriorize energy less frequently as you will only be working to maintain the field. The ideal would  be  to  start  in  the  bedroom  and  create  the  energetic  shield around  it  first—as  this  is  the  room  in  which  you  sleep  and  project from.  Then  gradually  do  the  other  rooms  in  your  house  until  your whole home is an energetic haven. </p>
<p>Being proficient at exteriorizing energies is also a great tool for self-defense when you are out of the body. As you still have access to your dense energies via the silver cord (in addition to the energies of the extraphysical body itself), if any extraphysical consciousnesses bother you while you’re projected, exteriorize energy to them with your best wishes but also with the very clear signal that you want nothing to do with them and that they should leave you be. In the vast majority of cases, one single pulse of energy sent in their direction is enough to send most intruders on their way. </p>
<p><b>Vibrational State</b></p>
<p> <i>Definition:</i> “The condition of maximal and simultaneous dynamisation of  the  chakras,  promoted  by  the  conscious  mobilization  of  one’s energies up and down the body.” (Trivellato and Gustus, 2003) May <a id="p92"></a>also occur spontaneously. </p>
<p> <i>Comments:</i></p>
<p>Unlike  the  absorption  and  exteriorization  exercises,  there  are  no restrictions as to where or when you should install a vibrational state as it is the most powerful tool we have at our disposal for energetic self-defense. </p>
<p><b>How do I do it? </b></p>
<p>Be relaxed, sit, or lie down if you prefer, and focus on accumulating and sensing your energies in your head. Then slowly, will yourself to move  the  energy  down  through  the  internal  core  of  your  body  (as opposed  to  feeling  the  sensations  on  your  skin  or  on  the  outside  of your  body),  towards  your  feet.  Pay  attention  to  where  you  can  and can’t perceive the energy. If you can’t feel the energy in a particular area  of  the  body  it  may  be  because  there  is  an  energetic  blockage there. Keep the energy moving, back up towards the head, and then down  again  to  the  feet,  and  so  on.  Remember  that  most  people unfamiliar  with  such  exercises  have  little  or  no  perception  of  the movement of energy at first. But the mere attempt usually produces some small results, even if you are unaware of them, so don’t give up. </p>
<p>Persist.  Gradually,  increase  both  the  intensity  and  the  speed  of  the flow  of  energy,  moving  it  faster  and  faster  up  and  down  the  body, until such time as you “lose” the flow of the energy and you reach the vibrational state. </p>
<p><b>How does it feel? </b></p>
<p>The following authors offer these descriptions:</p>
<p>The vibrational state is characterized by the movement of internal pulsating  waves  similar  to  electrical  vibrations  whose  occurrence, frequency and intensity can be controlled at will to be fast or slow, strong or weak. These waves sweep the immobilized soma (body) from  head  to  hands  and  feet,  returning  to  the  brain  in  a  steady cycle  of  a  few  seconds.  The  occurrence  at  times  seems  like  a burning torch, surging and ebbing, or a ball of tolerable electricity guided at will. Not uncommonly, the vibrations produce a sensation of  inflation  common  in  psychophony  (vocal  channeling)  with  the apparent  expansion  and  swelling  of  the  hands,  feet,  lips,  cheeks, chin  and  solar  plexus  area.  (Waldo  Vieira,  <i>Projections  of  the</i></p>
<p><a id="p93"></a> <i>Consciousness</i>)</p>
<p>In spite of being very exotic and intense, the sensation of vibration is quite pleasant, and sometimes through its intensification a sort of <i>energetic  climax</i>  is  reached.  (Wagner  Alegretti,  <i>Retrocognitions:  An Investigation  into  the  Memory  of  Past  Lives  and  the  Period  between Lives</i>)</p>
<p>It  is  as  if  a  surging,  hissing,  rhythmically  pulsating  wave  of  fiery sparks comes roaring into your head. From there it seems to sweep throughout  your  body,  making  it  rigid  and  immobile.  (Robert Monroe,  <i>Journeys Out of the Body</i>)</p>
<p>According to my own experience, I can best describe the vibrational state as a condition in which you are acutely aware that every single cell in your body, including the cells of your skin, in your blood and internal  organs,  your  bones,  your  brain,  etc.,  is  furiously  vibrating against the cell next to it. The experience promotes a deep sense of well-being. </p>
<p><b>What are the benefits? </b></p>
<p>As explained in the article written with Trivellato, the correct use of the  vibrational  state  has  significant  benefits.  When  we  install  the vibrational  state,  we  establish  an  energetic  shield  around  us  that prevents  anyone  from  aurically  coupling  (energetically  interfusing) with us. So the vibrational state “enables us to neutralize unwanted influences  and  intrusions  that  we  have  either  knowingly  or unknowingly  come  into  contact  with,  and  to  play  therefore  a  more active,  decisive  role  in  our  lives.  This  in  turn  stimulates  personal maturation and evolutionary growth.” (Trivellato and Gustus, 2003) The vibrational state should be used in advance and in anticipation of  intrusion,  in  other  words,  before  any  situation  in  which  you  can predict that someone will try to force his energies on you or steal your energies.  Next  time  you  find  yourself  about  to  enter  a  challenging situation  in  which  you  might,  for  example,  have  to  deal  with  an aggressive customer, make your point in a hostile meeting, confront someone  over  the  telephone  or  handle  any  other  situation  in  which you  anticipate  being  imposed  upon  energetically,  try  to  install  the vibrational state beforehand and see what results. </p>
<p>Similarly,  install  the  vibrational  state  before  entering  any  area  or <a id="p94"></a>environment where you suspect or perceive extraphysical intruders to be. If you do become aware of being intruded, don’t just accept it. Do the vibrational state and get rid of it otherwise a superficial intrusion can become a profound one. </p>
<p>As the installation of the vibrational state promotes flexibility and looseness  of  the  energy  body,  it  also  greatly  facilitates  the disconnection of the extraphysical body from the physical body and therefore,  the  promotion  of  lucid  out-of-body  experiences.  Some people  frequently  enjoy  spontaneous  vibrational  states  as  precursors to conscious projections. </p>
<p>The vibrational state and the conscious exteriorization of energy are also  techniques  for  clearing  energetic  blockages,  and  can  be  very useful as a means of preventing mini-illnesses in that regard. If I ever feel myself coming down with a cold or the flu, for example, I do the vibrational state as much as I can and exteriorize energy through my throat  chakra  several  times  a  day.  Often,  the  symptoms  quickly disappear. I have had very few colds or flus take hold since I began consciously working with energies in this way nine years ago. </p>
<p><b>Tips for Mastering Your Bioenergy</b></p>
<p>It  is  important  to  emphasize  here  that  everyone  has  the  capacity  to work consciously with bioenergies in all the ways I have described. It is  not  necessary  to  have  any  particular  aptitude  or  to  be  especially sensitive.  The  reason  that  relatively  few  people  are  consciously working with bioenergy in their everyday lives is simply because most of  us  were  never  taught  how  to  do  it.  If,  from  a  young  age,  your parents had showed you to how to do these energetic exercises and activities  in  the  same  way  that  they  had  taught  you  how  to  ride  a bike, you would have mastered your bioenergies before you reached your teens. </p>
<p>The most important factor in attaining mastery of one’s bioenergies is  willpower.  Improving  our  energetic  performance  via  any  of  the three techniques mentioned may appear simple enough on paper, but the  amount  of  personal  discipline  and  effort  required  to  produce worthwhile results is not to be trivialized. (ibid, 2003) The  ideal  is  to  aim  to  be  able  to  work  with  energies  in  any conditions  and  circumstances  (internal  or  external),  and  not  to  be dependent upon being alone, being able to lie down and relax or on <a id="p95"></a>performing  any  other  unnecessary  ritual,  as  neither  physical  nor extraphysical intruders will wait until the conditions are ideal for you to be able to defend yourself before imposing themselves. While most determined  individuals  are  able  to  achieve  good  results  in  terms  of absorbing  and  exteriorizing  energy  within  some  months  of  practice, being able to install an effective vibrational state, anywhere, anytime —no matter what—is an endeavor that may take some years of effort to accomplish. </p>
<p>Having said  that, many  thousands of  people  all around  the  world are  already  deriving  enormous  benefit  from  controlling  their bioenergies. Many have developed their paraperceptions to the point of  knowing  what  is  going  on  around  them  nonphysically—precisely who  is  there  and  exactly  where  they  are—and  are  able  to  maintain their  balance  regardless.  As  a  result,  they  experience  greater  self-confidence and serenity, safe in the knowledge that the control over their  lives  is  very  much  in  their  hands,  and  they  enjoy  the  many unique  benefits  of  being  in  direct  contact  with  the  advanced, extraphysical helpers. Mastering bioenergies also enables practitioners to: sense and clear energetic blockages, which leads to greater general equilibrium and well-being, and improved health; promote flexibility of the energy body, which in turn triggers the nonalignment of one’s vehicles  of  manifestation—and  leads  to  conscious  projection;  and increase  their  overall  level  of  lucidity  regarding  their multidimensional reality. </p>
<p>So while the level of commitment and discipline required to achieve mastery of your bioenergies may seem high, the rewards and benefits for you in terms of your personal development in the short, medium and long term (i.e. in your future lives) will be immeasurably greater. </p>
