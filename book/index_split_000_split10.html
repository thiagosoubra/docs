<p>Nonphysical Dimensions</p>
<p>It  is  the  commonest  of  mistakes  to  consider  that  the  limit  of  our power of perception is also the limit of all there is to perceive. </p>
<p> <i>—C.W. Leadbeater</i></p>
<p>Of  all  the  fascinating  facts  and  tidbits  of  information  peppered throughout Vieira’s classic work  <i>Projectiology</i>, one of the most telling describes  humankind’s  overwhelming  acknowledgment  of  the multidimensional  structure  of  existence.  Vieira  cites  the  studies  of Chinese researcher Professor Solon Wang, who classified the world’s fourteen most important schools of knowledge as follows: Western religions—Christianity, Islam and Judaism Western  philosophies—European  Spiritualism,  Greek  and Materialism Eastern religions—Buddhism, Hinduism and Zoroastrianism Eastern philosophies—Confucianism, Taoism and Yoga Sciences—natural (ancient) and new (psychic)</p>
<p>Only two of the fourteen (Materialism and ancient science) mandate physicality  as  a  condition  of  reality.  The  other  twelve  acknowledge that the physical dimension is but one of several dimensions of which the true conformation of existence is composed. (Vieira, 2002) In the face of such evidence, it is a paradox that many followers of these schools of knowledge accept nonphysical dimensions as reality within the context of their belief systems and faiths, yet not within the context of their ordinary, everyday lives. For example, many people fully  subscribe  to  the  concept  of  an  afterlife,  yet  in  complete contradiction to that belief, are totally skeptical of the possibility of being able to function with awareness independently of the physical body. </p>
<p> <i><b>Extraphysical  dimensions  and  layers  are  often  characterized<a id="p44"></a> according  to  their  levels  of  frequency,  vibration  or  subtlety.  To expand this understanding, extraphysical districts can be described as  different  levels  of  reality  determined  by  the  density  of  energies,  and  the  level  of  lucidity  and  the  quality  of  thoughts,  ideas  and emotions  of  the  consciousnesses  residing  or  transiting  there.  This makes sense when you take into account the most essential principle of nonphysical geography, which is that extraphysical environments are  not  places  with  geographical  locations  but  states  of consciousness. </b></i></p>
<p>This  is  not  such  an  easy  concept  to  grasp  at  first,  but  if  you  are interested in understanding the various realities of the extraphysical world, a serious dose of neophilia (openness to new ideas) is required, because the extraphysical dimensions are not governed by the laws of our material existence. </p>
<p>We  can,  nonetheless,  draw  some  parallels  to  facilitate  our understanding of nonphysical realities. </p>
<p>For  example,  when  thinking  about  where  the  extraphysical dimensions are, we can say that many of them coexist and share space with the physical dimension. They are all around us. They are right here,  right  now.  This  fact  is  much  easier  to  understand  when  we remember that we are also sharing space with innumerable invisible artificial  electromagnetic  waves,  such  as  those  used  to  broadcast television  and  radio  and  to  transmit  data  across  mobile  phone networks and between aircraft and military installations. Radio alone broadcasts over hundreds of different frequencies and bands. Strictly speaking,  there  are  an  infinite  number  of  frequencies  across  the electromagnetic spectrum. </p>
<p>When you choose one station and stay there, that is your experience and  your  reality  for  a  short  while.  But  that  doesn’t  mean  the  other stations don’t exist. In exactly the same way as there are an infinite number of frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum, there are an infinite number of dimensions or extraphysical layers that make up our existence. Broadly speaking however, it is correct to say that our existence  is  composed  of  the  physical  dimension,  the  extraphysical dimension  and  the  mental  dimension,  with  the  extraphysical dimension  being  separated  into  multiple  layers,  many  of  which  are further divided into districts or zones. </p>
<p>Let’s  take  a  closer  look  at  the  similarities,  differences  and <a id="p45"></a>peculiarities  of  the  extraphysical  layers,  starting  with  the  denser layers  more  closely  connected  to  and  associated  with  the  physical dimension. </p>
<p><b>The Extraphysical Sphere of Energy</b></p>
<p>If a projector is able to experience the detachment and take-off of the extraphysical  body  from  the  physical  body  with  full  awareness,  the first place he is likely to find himself is in the extraphysical sphere of energy.  This  extraphysical  force  field  surrounds  the  human  body, extending four meters in every direction (having the physical head at its center). Since this force field overlaps with the physical dimension, its energies are relatively dense in comparison to other extraphysical layers. As such, the extraphysical sphere of energy acts as an interface between the physical and extraphysical dimensions. </p>
<p>When  the  extraphysical  body  is  floating  within  the  extraphysical sphere of energy, in close proximity to the physical body, one’s energy body undergoes a transformation as part of it begins to take the shape of  the  silver  cord.  Before  this  transformation  has  been  fully completed,  the  silver  cord  can  easily  retract  to  reform  the  energy body, vigorously pulling the extraphysical body with it. So for those wanting to spend extended periods outside the body, the aim would be  to  move  away  from  the  human  body  as  quickly  as  possible.  The influence of terrestrial gravity in the extraphysical sphere of energy is also notable and has the effect of making the extraphysical body feel heavier than when it is outside of the sphere. </p>
<p>Various  phenomena  also  occur  with  greater  intensity  here  due  to the density of the energetic field, for example:</p>
<p>•    instability  of  the  extraphysical  body—characterized  as  a rocking or oscillation. </p>
<p>•    extraphysical  double  awareness—a  sensation  that  can accompany the transition of the consciousness from the brain of the physical body to the (para)brain of the extraphysical body in which the projector experiences his lucidity in the physical  and extraphysical  bodies  at  the  same  time.  Note  however  that  the consciousness does not divide itself but can only be present in its entirety in one body of manifestation at any given moment. </p>
<p>•  extraphysical double vision—when part of a person’s vision is <a id="p46"></a>in the human body and part is in the extraphysical body; in other words,  when  one’s  normal  physical  vision  and  clairvoyance operate simultaneously. </p>
<p>•  slow-motion extraphysical movement—often described as the feeling of wading through mud or water. </p>
<p>As the extraphysical sphere of energy is a new environment for most of  us  and  exhibits  many  unique  characteristics  with  which  the majority of us are unfamiliar, it can take a little time to adapt to the sensations and phenomena that are commonly experienced there. </p>
<p><b>The Crustal Dimension (Paratroposphere)</b></p>
<p>Slightly  less  dense  energetically  than  the  extraphysical  sphere  of energy  is  the  earth’s  crustal  dimension  (or  paratroposphere),  which lies  within  the  earth’s  atmosphere.  As  the  environments  of  the paratroposphere  are  closely  connected  to  earth,  they  duplicate terrestrial  environments  and  life  there  coexists  and  overlaps  with human  life.  This  extraphysical  zone  has  been  given  many  names throughout history and is commonly known as the crustal plane, the astral  plane,  the  after-death  world,  and  the  spiritual  world  …  the place in which spirits or lost souls remain earth-bound. </p>
<p> <i><b>Because of man’s indoctrination to his material, physical existence and  general  lack  of  openness  to  and  preparedness  for  the  actual nonphysical realities of life after death, when most people die their lucidity dramatically diminishes. Simply put, they don’t understand what’s going on. Their natural tendency then is to gravitate towards the  familiarity  of  the  paratropospheric  communities  that  coincide with the earth’s area of influence. The paratroposphere is, as such,  densely  populated  in  the  same  way  that  our  planet  is  densely populated. </b></i></p>
<p><b>Inhabitants of the Paratroposphere</b></p>
<p>While a lower level of lucidity characterizes most inhabitants of the earth’s  paratroposphere,  many  of  its  inhabitants  are   <i>completely</i> unaware of their extraphysical state … they have no idea that they are dead.  One  cause  of  this  condition  is  an  excessive  attachment  to physical life. Many people believe that physical life is everything; it’s all  there  is,  and  that  when  they  die  they  will  cease  to  exist.  Their attitude  doesn’t  change  just  because  they  die,  so  as  long  as  they <a id="p47"></a>experience  their  awareness,  they  think  they’re  still  alive  in  the physical  sense.  This  explains  why  individuals  in  this  condition typically remain earth-bound. Many stay close to former family and friends, attempting to participate in their former lives. Usually, they eventually  degenerate  into  an  unbalanced  state  of  despair  and confusion  as  their  physical  loved  ones  are  unable  to  perceive  or interact  with  them,  they  are  unable  to  make  any  sense  of  their experiences, and also because they are affected by the confusion and distress of others in their proximity. Many also become disturbed by a literally insatiable hunger for the emotions they derived from physical activities  such  as  giving  and  receiving  affection,  eating,  drinking, taking drugs and having sex; activities that they can no longer partake in because they don’t have the means (i.e. a human body) to do so. </p>
<p>This common condition, often characterized by an intense stare, is known  as  post-mortem  parapsychosis  (from  the  Latin   <i>post-mortem</i> meaning after death,  <i>para</i> meaning beyond the physical, and psychosis meaning  any  severe  form  of  mental  disorder).  Although  the  crustal layers  are  crowded  with  consciousnesses  in  this  condition,  we  more commonly  hear  about  the  very  few  who  are  able  to  use  the  dense energy known as ectoplasm to perform direct actions in the physical dimension  …  the  poltergeists  or  hauntings.  Poltergeists  can  move physical  objects  or  cause  them  to  fly,  produce  noises,  smells,  air currents and apparitions etc. </p>
<p>I  mentioned  earlier  that  extraphysical  environments  are  states  of consciousness,  as  opposed  to  geographical  locations  that  fall  within our current understanding of space. The mechanics of how a state of mind  is  the  underlying  cause  that  gives  rise  to  the  creation  of  a particular  environment  is  demonstrated  very  well  by  the paratropospheric extraphysical communities. </p>
<p>It is understood in conscientiology that a consciousness’s thoughts, emotions and energy are inextricably linked; in other words, that the quality  of  an  individual’s  energy  is  influenced  by  the  quality  of  his thoughts,  intentions,  ideas  and  feelings.  So  when  large  groups  of kindred extraphysical consciousnesses reflect and dwell on the same subject, consistently producing fixed ideas that persist over hundreds of  years,  eventually  the  energies  of  the  group  generate  powerful, permanent thought-forms, nonphysical energetic expressions of ideas that behave like and appear to be actual structures. The thought-forms <a id="p48"></a>are  not  permanent  in  the  strictest  sense,  but  they  no  longer  require direct, conscious management by anyone to be sustained. They have become part of a nonphysical environment because they are accepted and simply by being acknowledged, energy is added to them. </p>
<p>Let’s  consider,  for  example,  the  fact  that  many  thousands  of extraphysical  individuals  whose  most  recent  life  was  spent  living  in London  are  suffering  from  post-mortem  parapsychosis.  The  heavy influence of the environment in which they now exist (and to which they  contribute  due  to  their  diminished  lucidity)  coerces  them  into maintaining  the  fantasy  that  they  are  leading  a  ‘normal’  physical existence. In other words, they contribute with their energies to the maintenance  of  existing  thought-forms  that  have  been  built  up  by others  in  the  same  condition  over  many  centuries.  Over  time,  these thought-forms  have  molded  an  extraphysical  replica  of  the  city  of London  that  approximates  its  streets,  buildings  and  landmarks.  This process  is  even  more  intense  when  large  groups  of  people  pass through  the  first  death  and  go  together  to  the  extraphysical environment  at  (or  around)  the  same  time,  as  happened  during  the London Blitz in World War II. </p>
<p>In these sorts of environments individuals create the way in which they  interact  with  their  reality  for  themselves.  There  is  no  external influence  that  imposes  change  (as  often  happens  in  the  physical environment where people are forced to change when they lose a job or  are  promoted,  lose  or  gain  a  partner,  contract  a  life-threatening disease, etc.), so until they decide to do something different, nothing changes.  Because  of  this,  some  people,  lacking  the  lucidity  to understand  their  own  predicament,  become  stuck  and  may  spend hundreds  of  years  in  a  condition  of  very  low  awareness.  Often,  in order to be rehabilitated, enlightened as to their state and moved to a more suitable environment (some projectors refer to this activity as a rescue or retrieval), they still require human resources such as dense energy, and this is something that conscious projectors can provide as the  extraphysical  body  departs  the  physical  body  carrying  some proportion of the energy body with it. </p>
<p>Most large human cities have an extraphysical equivalent. Can you imagine  what  might  be  going  on  in  the  extraphysical  duplicate  of Jerusalem, the sacred place of three major religions with its long and complicated history? Yes. There is war in the crustal dimension. Most <a id="p49"></a>human problems we experience in the physical dimension are echoed in  the  extraphysical  world.  Human  nature  is  human  nature everywhere we go. </p>
<p>When  extraphysical  layers  overlap  with  physical  life  in  this  way, often the extraphysical buildings mirror both the exterior appearance and  interior  decoration  of  actual  physical  homes  and  may  even  be temporarily inhabited by a deceased person who resided there during his last physical incarnation. This characteristic of the crustal layers causes  much  confusion  among  conscious  projectors  who  sometimes find themselves in environments that are intimately familiar yet not exactly  the  same  as  those  they  know,  as  slight  modifications  or variations are common in the extraphysical duplicate. </p>
<p>For example, Wagner Alegretti, the President of the IAC, recounts how  during  one  of  his  first  projections  as  a  teenager  he  passed  out through  the  roof  of  his  house  and  was  peering  down  at  the  empty field next door. But instead of seeing the usual grass and the one tree he knew to be there, he could see a construction that appeared to be an  office  block  of  some  kind.  All  this  was  very  confusing  until  he realized that when you are outside the body you can still distinguish some elements of the terrestrial dimension as you start to see parts of the extraphysical dimension. This is how the dimensions overlap. </p>
<p>Robert Monroe recounted several visits to the crustal dimension in his three books, reporting the following in the second,  <i>Far Journeys:</i> But I knew the next rin<a href="index_split_002_split13.html#p248">g1</a> inward. It wasn’t nice. Beyond that was physical life. The two were tightly interwoven, the thick ring just slightly  out  of  phase  with  physical  matter.  It  was  the  interface between  one  reality  system  and  another.  Even  from  this perspective, it was difficult for a novice to distinguish instantly the differences between the two. But I could. </p>
<p>That was the problem. The inhabitants of this ring couldn’t. They didn’t or couldn’t or wouldn’t realize they were no longer physical. </p>
<p>They were physically dead. No more physical body. Thus they kept trying to be physical, to do and be what they had been, to continue to be physical one way or another. Bewildered, some spent all of their activity in attempting to communicate with friends and loved ones still in bodies or with anyone else who might come along, all to  no  avail.  Others  were  held  attracted  to  physical  sites  in  which they  had  instilled  great  meaning  or  importance  during  their <a id="p50"></a>previous human lifetime. (Far Journeys, Robert Monroe, Doubleday and Eleanor Friede Books)</p>
<p>Author Bruce Moen, in  <i>Voyage Beyond Doubt</i>, the second volume in the Exploring the Afterlife series, offered similar insights when describing his work helping such individuals to become aware of the fact they were dead during his out-of-body travels. </p>
<p>During  past  experience  doing  retrievals,  I’d  discovered  people sometimes  get  ‘stuck’  after  they  die.  Often  the  circumstances  of their  death  or  their  beliefs  about  an  afterlife  are  responsible  for their being “stuck”. (Moen, 1998)</p>
<p>Moen makes two points that are very interesting to note. First, that in addition to erroneous beliefs about the afterlife, sometimes people are completely unaware they have died due to the circumstances of their death.  This  might  include  people  who  died  unexpectedly  in  their sleep, such as victims of sudden natural disasters like landslides and earthquakes, or victims of unforeseen traffic accidents. Second Moen also notes that people’s beliefs about the afterlife can cause them to be "stuck.”  For  example,  if  a  person  has  been  indoctrinated  to  a  belief system that maintains that a life well-lived (a highly relative notion) will  be  rewarded  with  an  eternity  floating  in  the  lush  environs  of paradise and then the reality doesn’t match up, the ensuing downward spiral  into  post-mortem  parapsychosis  can  be  extremely  difficult  to reverse. </p>
<p>The fact that you are open to reading the information in this book and to considering various afterlife realities will help you to be more prepared for what awaits you after death. The ideal, however, would be to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the out-of-body experience, by using it as a tool to visit the earth’s paratroposphere while  you  are  alive,  to  witness  and  experience  for  yourself  the condition of those who reside there. This will help you to fulfill any expectation you may have of spending your next period between lives in a state of awareness of your extraphysical condition and of passing your time there doing something other than mimicking your current existence. </p>
<p><b>Paratropospheric Communities</b></p>
<p>The crustal layers are composed of an extraordinarily diverse range of communities,  as  is  our  physical  world.  The  majority  of <a id="p51"></a>consciousnesses  gravitate  towards  colonies  that  reflect  the  mentality of groups with which they associated in former physical lives. There are,  for  example,  communities  formed  by  individuals  with  a predominantly  masculine  or  feminine  mentality  while  others  have predominantly homosexual tendencies. Some communities are defined by  the  former  profession  of  its  inhabitants.  There  are  colonies  of former  politicians,  musicians,  writers,  scientists,  military  personnel, criminals, mafia and those employed in the sex trade who continue to lead promiscuous existences between physical lives. </p>
<p>Some zones in the crustal dimension echo the misery, squalor and moral  degeneration  of  human  slums  where  homelessness,  violence, drug-trafficking, extortion, gangs and delinquency are the order of the day.  Others,  inhabited  by  consciousnesses  suffering  from schizophrenia and other mental illnesses, are chaotic places devoid of any semblance of organization, where past traumas are relived over and over. Certain places are considerably worse than anything found on earth. Scenes from films such as  <i>What Dreams May Come</i> and more recently,  <i>Constantine</i>,  that  depict  seething  masses  of  lost,  panicked people crawling all over one another, are not inaccurate reflections of some truly sorrowful extraphysical realities. </p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the communities dwelling in the earth’s paratroposphere reflect human nature, so we find the good as well  as  the  bad  and  the  ugly  there.  What  is  common  to  all  these communities is their attachment to the physical dimension, (in terms of  affinities  not  proximity).  So  the  quality  of  any  particular extraphysical  area,  ethically-speaking,  may  be  influenced  by  the quality  of  the  terrestrial  environment  or  community  to  which  it  is linked.  There  are  paratropospheric  communities  associated  with  the offices  and  work  of  humanitarian  aid  organizations  in  various countries around the world, for example. Equally, however, it can be argued  that  it  is  the  quality  of  a  particular  extraphysical  area  that influences  the  quality  of  the  terrestrial  environment  to  which  it  is linked. As always, we have the chicken and egg scenario. Which came first—the  physical  community  or  the  extraphysical  community?  In fact, both scenarios are possible. </p>
<p>The  less  evolved  paratropospheric  districts  have  been  visited  by numerous  conscious  projectors  over  the  centuries  and  their characteristics  have  been  well-documented.  Readers  of  Robert <a id="p52"></a>Monroe’s books would know these areas as Locale II while others may know them by one of several other names given to them by projectors throughout  history  such  as  Hades,  Inferno,  Kamaloka,  Purgatory  or Umbral. (Vieira, 2002)</p>
<p><b>The Extraphysical Dimensions</b></p>
<p>Moving  away  from  the  paratropospheric  regions  that  lie  within  the earth’s  atmosphere,  the  energies  of  the  extraphysical  layers  become more  subtle.  These  layers  are  inaccessible  to  individuals  residing permanently  in  the  crustal  layers  who  have  not  passed  through  the second  death  and  so  are  still  laden  with  the  dense  energies  of  the energy  body.  For  them,  trying  to  access  more  subtle  dimensions  is akin to mixing oil with water. </p>
<p> <i><b>Throughout the extraphysical dimension, we see an extraordinary diversity and complexity of existences, including everything that lies within  accepted  parameters  of  what  is  real  and  a  whole  lot  that doesn’t. </b></i></p>
<p>In  the  crustal  layers,  as  we’ve  just  seen,  the  majority  of consciousnesses  are  not  creating  anything  new  but  are  just  copying physical  life.  Other  extraphysical  dimensions  are  inhabited  by communities  that  are  locked  in  unevolved  levels  of  existence reminiscent of our Middle Ages and even the primitive ages. There are zones  that  coincide  with  our  underground  and  with  the  deepest abysses  of  the  ocean,  and  others  that  are  nothing  but  a  void.  No thought-forms have been created there. </p>
<p>By contrast, in some layers you can interact with the environment on many different levels. You can touch, feel, see, smell and sense in much  the  same  way  as  you  can  in  the  physical  plane.  Things  feel solid. You can lift them. Some extraphysical objects can’t be broken or even  scratched  because  their  internal  cohesion  is  so  strong.  Other objects can’t be moved. This means that the individuals who created these  thought-forms  did  so  with  large  quantities  of  energy,  or  the thought-forms were created and reenforced over a very long period of time. </p>
<p>Some nonphysical areas don’t have a ground as we know it. They are adapted to the needs of residents who fly, so rather than having floors,  roads  and  motorways,  the  communities  are  vertical  and  the buildings  resemble  bell  towers,  open  on  all  sides  to  facilitate  the <a id="p53"></a>coming and going of the consciousnesses living there. </p>
<p>There are places in which space is not transparent as it is here. You can  still  see  a  good  distance,  but  everything  is  cloaked  in  a  type  of fine mist or fog. Some environments don’t have stars, planets or a sun, and the only light is the self-illumination of your extraphysical body or of the surrounding extraphysical matter. </p>
<p>Projectors  have  reported  visiting  zones  that  have  meteorological-like conditions and others that have periods of calm interspersed with extraphysical storms that rain a type of fire instead of water, sending all the residents scurrying for shelter. You see extraphysical nature in some places … flora and fauna that are often very different to what we know. Waldo Vieira once came across a kind of miniature giraffe while he was out of the body. He was able to communicate with it telepathically  and  found  it  to  be  quite  intelligent.  In  terms  of  flora, there  are  some  equivalents  of  plants.  The  leaves,  not  always  green, can be luminous or transparent. </p>
<p><b>Advanced Nonphysical Communities</b></p>
<p>Elsewhere in  the vast  extraphysical dimension  that  is as  limitless  as the  physical  are  futuristic  communities  that  are  significantly  more advanced  than  ours,  where  the  consciousnesses  are  using  tools  and updated  technologies  superior  to  anything  we  know.  Some  of  these areas have absolutely no commonality with the physical dimension at all  and  could  be  described  as  the  nonphysical  equivalent  of extraterrestrial  environments  inhabited  by  extraterrestrial  life-forms. </p>
<p>(Alegretti, 2005)</p>
<p>Residing  in  the  most  subtle,  rarefied  energetic  layers  of  the extraphysical  dimension,  closer  to  the  mental  dimension,  are communities of more lucid, evolved nonphysical beings. </p>
<p>In general, people exhibit the same capacities in their physical and extraphysical  existences.  So  by  no  means  are  all  extraphysical consciousnesses operating at full capacity. For example, some can’t fly or pass through solid, physical objects because they don’t believe they can  and  are  restricted  by  their  own  limitations.  More  lucid consciousnesses  by  contrast,  understand  the  mechanism  of materializing  thought-forms  as  objects  and,  limited  only  by  their imagination, create tools, technologies, houses and other buildings to fabricate existences that rival our best science-fiction movies. </p>
<p><a id="p54"></a>The  more  organized,  advanced  nonphysical  communities  are usually involved in one of two tasks, either preparing individuals for the next physical life or welcoming and rehabilitating those who have recently died. </p>
<p>Those consciousnesses who are lucid and are preparing to be reborn commonly undergo a kind of training for their next physical life. This subject is discussed in more detail in <a href="index_split_002_split1.html#p157">chapter 10</a>. </p>
<p>Many  more  of  the  advanced  extraphysical  communities,  however, are dedicated to the ongoing and problematic work of assisting those who  have  recently  died  and  have  arrived  in  the  extraphysical dimension  from  physical  life,  often  in  a  state  of  trauma,  shock  or bewilderment.  Individuals  from  these  more-evolved  layers  work  in extraphysical  clinics  and  hospitals  working  with  people  who  are  in need  of  help  and  healing.  The  ambience  of  these  places  of convalescence  is  bleak,  in  stark  contrast  to  those  involved  in preparing  candidates  for  human  life,  which  are  typified  by  positive feelings  of  hope,  opportunity  and  the  anticipation  of  achieving planned goals. </p>
<p>Some advanced communities not involved in the various functions already described might be inhabited by geniuses, while residents of other evolved layers might be examples of serenity and ethics. If you project  to  places  like  this,  you  find  beauty  and  order  beyond  your imagination.  Projected  human  beings  have  brought  back  many inspirations  from  these  extraphysical  communities  for  various  forms of art such as painting and sculpture, and music and literature. By the same  process,  however,  some  people  have  reconstructed  accurate representations  of  actual  extraphysical  environments  to  create  the horror-movies of our worst nightmares. In a similar fashion, some of the music that plays over the radio in the physical dimension echoes the music of some unevolved paratropospheric colonies. </p>
<p> <i><b>So what is more real—the physical dimension or the extraphysical dimensions? Which is copying which? Just as so many people do not believe  in  extraphysical  realities,  many  extraphysical consciousnesses  do  not  believe  in  and  are  totally  skeptical  of  our physical reality. When we insist that the framework of our material existence  provides  fixed  reference  points  within  which  everything else must fit, we severely limit the way in which we experience our existence. </b></i></p>
<p><a id="p55"></a><b>The Mental Dimension</b></p>
<p>Beyond the extraphysical dimension lies the mental dimension, which is  native  to  the  mental  body  and  is  the  native  environment  of  the consciousness  <i>per se. </i></p>
<p>We can say the mental dimension is right here right now, as is the extraphysical dimension. We don’t perceive it totally, but there is an interaction in the same way there is with the extraphysical dimension. </p>
<p>But as we saw in <a href="index_split_000_split9.html#p29">chapter 1, </a> the reality of the mental dimension is so subtle  and  different  from  our  reality  here  that  we  need  a  different type of sensitivity and a significant amount of maturity, balance and openness to perceive it. </p>
<p>The  best  way  to  study  the  mental  dimension  is  to  have  a  mental projection. When we are between lives, existing in the extraphysical dimension, we have projections in the mental dimension. So we will already have some memory of these episodes in the integral memory of our mental body. </p>
<p><b>Characteristics of the Mental Dimension</b></p>
<p>But what is the mental dimension like? The energies of the level of existence  there  are  so  subtle  that  nothing  has  form.  In  the extraphysical dimension there is a reality that we can see, but in the mental  dimension  there’s  not  enough  energy  attached  to  your thoughts  to  shape  anything.  You  think,  but  no  forms  are  created. </p>
<p>Everything remains in the realm of ideas. So in the mental dimension there is nothing to see. </p>
<p>Nor is there space in the way there is here, so there is no separation between  one  person  and  another  there  even  though  everyone maintains  his  individuality.  If  we  were  to  meet  there  I  wouldn’t  be able to say you are on my left, I am on your right. There is no above, beyond, floor or ceiling. </p>
<p>Similarly, there’s no time. There is no before and after. Sometimes when we are projected in the extraphysical body with no restriction from the physical brain, we can access memories of our past lives or have  some  precognitions  of  the  future.  With  the  mental  body, however, as we’re dealing purely with ideas with no concept of time, then something that happened in a past life is just there, imprinted on our  mental  body.  This  information  is  easily  accessed  in  this <a id="p56"></a>dimension. </p>
<p>Even  though  there  is  no  form  in  the  mental  dimension,  we  can immediately  perceive  and  recognize  one  another  on  a  purely parapsychic  level  with  our  memories,  thoughts,  emotions  and energies. We have our whole existence to identify us there. Our core is on display, not like in physical life where we can easily hide or mask our  true  thoughts,  opinions  and  ideas  behind  our  facial  expressions and words. </p>
<p>But how do we communicate there? Because we can’t even quantify the distance between us, there is no distance between you, your idea and me. So the moment you have an idea, I know. The moment I react to  your  idea,  you  know.  Ideas  are  communicated  en  bloc  via  a sophisticated  form  of  nonphysical  telepathy  that  has  no  articulated words or symbols. Whole blocks of thoughts and ideas just suddenly enter  the  consciousness.  For  example,  if  we  were  together  in  the mental dimension and I was to communicate the contents of this book to you, I could convey the information to you en bloc, instead of word by word as we are doing here. </p>
<p>The  consciousness  manifesting  in  the  mental  dimension  can  also acquire  new  information  that  presents  itself  in  a  sudden  insight. </p>
<p>Profound  knowledge,  intellectual  structures  or  visions  may  be acquired  in  this  way.  These  are  insights  of  a  complexity  whose magnitude  far  exceeds  the  most  enlightened  view  of  the  most capacious human being restricted by his physical brain, insights that clearly  never  occurred  to  the  same  person  while  in  the  ordinary, physical waking state. Some outputs of the acquisition of such original ideas  include  poetry,  prose,  solutions  to  all  manner  of  problems, inventiveness and scientific discoveries. </p>
<p>So  to  experience  the  mental  dimension  is  to  experience  an expansion of the consciousness, and a level of freedom, richness and sophistication  of  ideas,  memories  and  information  not  available  in other dimensions. Sadly, the unlimited nature of the experience is not so  easy  to  remember  because  of  the  restriction  imposed  by  the physical form of the brain. </p>
<p>It  is  interesting  to  note  the  parallels  between  conscientiology  and some of the world’s greatest religions in terms of the different “places" that exist in the afterlife. Certainly, according to anecdotal evidence provided by hundreds of lucid projectors throughout history, there are <a id="p57"></a>areas  in  the  extraphysical  dimensions  that  could  be  described  as paradise or heaven-like and others as hell-like, while we have already discussed  the  crustal  dimension  in  which  many  consciousnesses  are stuck in a kind of limbo where nothing changes. To compartmentalize the nonphysical dimensions into three afterlife destinations, however, is  to  over-simplify  the  diversity  and  complexity  of  the  extraphysical realities that may be experienced after death. </p>
