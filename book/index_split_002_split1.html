<p>Life Plan</p>
<p>Would any one of us undertake even a journey of a few hundred miles  without  knowing  why,  without  having  some  purpose?  And yet, so many of us live, undertaking not a chance task, but the great Task of life itself … and yet we ask not why. </p>
<p> <i>—J. J. Van Der Leeuw</i></p>
<p><b>Was My Life Planned? </b></p>
<p>I  would  like  to  preface  this  chapter  by  saying  that  much  of  the information  presented  here  lies  well  beyond  the  conventional paradigm  for  existence  and  that  there  are  few  experiences  you  may have  had  in  your  normal  everyday  lives  that  will  enable  you  to immediately  verify  some  of  it  for  yourself.  I  refer  you  back  to  the introduction in which I explain in detail the many sources of Vieira’s research. And as always, I encourage you to use the techniques and other  tips  described  in  <a href="index_split_002_split5.html#p205">part  4</a>  to  have  your  own  lucid  experiences outside  the  body  that  will  enable  you  to  confirm,  or  otherwise,  the contents of this chapter for yourself. </p>
<p>Some  elements  of  the  lives  of  all  of  us  were  decided  or  planned prior to our birth during our most recent period between lives. </p>
<p>How  much  planning  is  undertaken  in  preparation  for  a  person’s upcoming  life  is  largely  a  function  of  his  level  of  lucidity  between lives.  There  would  be  little  point  in  a  helper  formulating  a sophisticated life plan for a consciousness who doesn’t know he will have another life and is therefore unable to participate in the process. </p>
<p>If the plan isn’t stored in the individual’s own holomemory, there can be no clues suggestive of a deeper purpose in life for him to retrieve and act upon once he has returned to physical life. </p>
<p>In circumstances like these, helpers who are specialists in evolution will at least plan where and to whom a consciousness will be born, but beyond this, little may be arranged. </p>
<p><a id="p158"></a>Individuals  who   <i>are</i>  lucid  between  lives  and  aware  of  the evolutionary process that is natural to all consciousnesses, are often motivated  to  take  advantage  of  what  physical  life  offers  to  advance their  evolution,  to  resolve  some  karmic  debts  from  the  past  and  to contribute towards the evolution of others. A detailed, more complex plan  can  then  be  devised  during  the  intermissive  period  for  the accomplishment  of  these  goals.  While  an  individual  can  be  quite involved in planning his future life, the intervention and overall vision of  the  helpers  is  nonetheless  required  to  bring  together  the  myriad details of one’s personal history and holokarma to create the optimal strategy. (Alegretti, 2004)</p>
<p>The life plan relates specifically to the second half of physical life. </p>
<p>During the first half of our lives, up until the age of around 35, we are busy  maturing  and  building  a  foundation  of  sorts  for  our  physical existence. We receive an education, we study or train in a profession and then establish ourselves in a long-term job or career; this provides us with some level of financial stability, which in turn enables us to put  a  roof  over  our  heads.  Many  people  also  establish  their  life partnership  during  this  period,  fulfilling  their  daily  needs  for  love, affection  and  sex.  So  during  this  phase  of  life  we  prepare  the foundation necessary to support us in the execution of our life plan. </p>
<p>The life plan then is devised with the intention of executing it from the age of around 35 onwards. </p>
<p>Of  course  there  are  always  exceptions  to  the  general  rule  and  a small number  of more  lucid individuals  may  become aware  of  their life plan and start acting on it at an earlier age. </p>
<p> <i><b>Having  a  life  plan  does  not  mean  that  it  is  your  fate  to  carry  it out.  Don’t  forget,  you  always  have  the  right  to  exercise  your  free will.  So  even  if  you  were  involved  in  planning  the  details  of  your forthcoming  life,  and  you  remember  what  you  planned,  you  can always  choose  to  do  something  different.  Fate  is  a  myth.  This  is evidenced  by  the  fact  that  a  relatively  small  percentage  of  people with a life plan actually succeed in executing it. </b></i> The reasons for this are explained later in the chapter. </p>
<p>The  purpose  of  having  a  life  plan  then  is  to  optimize  the opportunities for the evolution of ourselves and others. </p>
<p>In  theory,  the  evolution  of  the  consciousness  is  a  personal individual  experience,  but  on  a  practical  level  humans  evolve  much, <a id="p159"></a>faster in groups—through interacting with others. To give an example, imagine there is a hermit who, in pursuit of “enlightenment,” decides to  spend  his  entire  life  meditating  alone  on  top  of  a  rock  on  a mountain peak, isolated from the whole of humanity. While he may develop his capacity to control his thoughts and his ability to master some  altered  states  of  consciousness,  do  you  think  his  isolation  will help him to evolve faster? No it won’t, simply because there is a limit to the amount and variety of challenges he will face and therefore a limit to how much he can learn and improve himself in one lifetime. </p>
<p>Being in a group on the other hand, requires that we develop the skills needed  to  deal  with  all  the  issues  that  arise  from  our  relationships with  others.  For  example,  do  you  have  the  maturity  to  accept  the authority of your superiors at work? Can you cope with having your weak  traits  exposed  as  happens  when  you  develop  an  intimate connection  with  someone?  Are  you  prepared  to  make  sacrifices  to help others or do you only offer assistance when it costs you nothing? </p>
<p>And whom do you help? Is it just your family and friends or do you also help people you don’t know? </p>
<p>A physical life that is rich in relationships and contact with others, with  challenges  and  experiences,  presents  us  with  opportunities  to evolve every day. </p>
<p> <i><b>The  life  plan  is  always  pitched  at  the  exact  level  of  a  person’s capacity,  taking  into  account  his  personal  strong  and  weak  traits;  meaning, everyone is capable of fulfilling his purpose in life as long as there is no self-corruption. Self-corruption is when we betray our own  principles;  it  is  when  there  is  no  coherence  between  what  we know and what we do. In other words, if we fail to accomplish what we planned to do in life, the problem is not in the planning but in the execution. </b></i></p>
<p>Having said that, the life plan is not set in stone, but is mutable. It is constantly being updated and redefined to take best advantage of the  opportunities  that  come  our  way,  and  to  allow  for  those opportunities  we  miss  as  well  as  for  unforeseen  circumstances.  So there are back-up plans in place. For example, perhaps your original life  plan  required  that  you  live  in  a  particular  country  where  you would have opportunities to address certain karmic issues with your group. So you were born there but let’s say at a very young age your country was invaded, your people became refugees and dispersed, and, <a id="p160"></a>you were separated from your family and taken to live in a foreign country.  In  cases  like  this,  the  helpers  will  modify  your  life  plan  to take into account your new circumstances. So the life plan is flexible, but we should take care not to use this as an excuse not to do it. </p>
<p><b>Mini and Maxi Life Plans</b></p>
<p>Not  everyone  has  a  specific  plan  for  the  upcoming  physical  life. </p>
<p>Consider  this  fact:  more  than  half  of  the  world’s  population—over three billion people—lives on less than two US dollars per day. <a href="index_split_002_split13.html#p248">4 </a>For them and many others trying to live on little more, the daily ordeals of survival consume all of their time and resources. Their experience of  existence  is  closer  to  an  instinctive  type  of  life  based  around fulfilling biological needs. </p>
<p>But any individual who was lucid during the period between lives will have a life plan or a specific purpose to his existence that falls into one of the following two categories: the mini life plan or the maxi life plan. </p>
<p><b>The Mini Life Plan</b></p>
<p>The  mini  life  plan  is  a  smaller,  simpler  plan  that  is  dedicated  to addressing egokarmic and groupkarmic issues. As it is more concerned with personal issues and less concerned with evolution, it is usually not so complex. For example, a person is born into a certain family to deal with his groupkarma. He then marries and has five children and perhaps ends up supporting his aging parents or a disabled sibling as well.  He  is  the  epicenter,  the  pillar  of  his  family  unit,  and  does  a wonderful  job  of  assuming  responsibility  for  the  many  people dependent on him. This is an example of a mini life plan dedicated to addressing one’s groupkarma. </p>
<p>Although the mini life plan is not so complex, that is not to say it can’t include multidimensional aspects. A shaman in Africa who acts as a bridge between humans and extraphysical consciousnesses as part of his work as a healer is also dealing with his groupkarma. It is still a mini life plan, but it has a multidimensional perspective. </p>
<p><b>The Maxi Life Plan</b></p>
<p>The  maxi  life  plan  is  a  more  advanced  strategy  that  is  undertaken knowingly and is dedicated to addressing polykarmic issues, i.e. issues, <a id="p161"></a>that  have  ramifications  for  the  whole  of  humanity.  Cosmoethical behavior; personal incorruptibility; a fraternal, universalistic attitude and assistance to others beyond one’s immediate family and friends, chiefly  through  clarification  (when  you  teach  others  to  help themselves),  are  the  hallmarks  of  a  maxi  life  plan.  A  hypothetical example of a maxi plan is a life intentionally dedicated to combating the  exploitation  of  the  weak  by  the  strong.  Some  of  the  wealthiest corporate  retail  manufacturers,  including  globally  recognizable brands, earn vast profits by exploiting the local labor in impoverished nations  around  the  world.  Workers  suffer  16-hour  days,  endure constant risks to their health and safety, live in over-crowded housing and  are  paid  barely  enough  to  survive  on  for  their  efforts.  An individual  who  chooses  to  work  with  an  international  organization, such  as  the  International  Labor  Organization  (ILO),  who  purposely devises  and  implements  programs  aimed  at  educating  vulnerable workers  on  basic  employment  rights  and  local  labor  laws,  could  be executing a maxi life plan. </p>
<p>Other examples of maxi life plans include dedicating one’s life to: brokering peace in the Middle East; inventing an affordable cure for AIDS;  campaigning  against  the  global  destruction  of  the  planet; challenging  nations  to  improve  their  human  rights;  and  researching sustainable energy resources. </p>
<p>Adaptability and more constant modification are usually required at this more advanced level. You may need to develop yourself to deal with people from many different countries and cultures or you may need  a  special  physical  body,  one  that  has  an  exceptionally  strong immune system and doesn’t easily fall ill, for example. </p>
<p>But  not  all  maxi  life  plans  have  a  multidimensional  component. </p>
<p>Take  the  example  of  physicist  Albert  Einstein.  His  revolutionary theories shaped our current understanding of space and time but his life plan addressed physical realities only. Another example is that of Mahatma Gandhi, who obtained independence for India, freeing one billion  Indians  from  British  rule  through  a  nonviolent  campaign  of civil disobedience. There was no multidimensional element to his life plan as such. A maxi plan that did have multidimensional aspects is illustrated  well  by  the  life  of  the  late  Jose  Arigo,  a  celebrated Brazilian  psychic  surgeon  who  healed  many  thousands  of  sick  and dying  people  while  channeling  a  consciousness  he  claimed  was, <a id="p162"></a>formerly a doctor. </p>
<p>The  level  of  complexity  of  a  person’s  life  plan,  therefore,  is  not determined  by  the  presence  or  absence  of  transdimensional  work. </p>
<p>What distinguishes a maxi plan from a mini plan is whether or not a person is consciously looking for evolution for himself and others. To put it another way, a life plan completed unconsciously is a mini plan. </p>
<p>The thresholds that separate mini and maxi plans are didactic only. </p>
<p>Consider the case of a primary school teacher who loves his job and is excellent at what he does. If he spends 40 years of his life teaching young  children  how  to  be  the  very  best  they  can  be,  inspiring confidence and  openness in  them, and  helping  them to  realize  their every potential, then he is working with individuals beyond his own groupkarma and is executing a kind of  <i>midi</i> life plan. </p>
<p><b>Success and Failure in the Endeavor to Carry Out One’s Life Plan</b></p>
<p>Completion of our life plan, regardless of whether it is a mini or maxi life  plan,  is  essential  for  our  evolution.  While  some  people  strive  to complete their task, others waste the opportunity that life presents to them and fail in this endeavor. </p>
<p>Generally,  people  who  are  aware  of  their  purpose  in  life  and dedicate themselves to fulfilling it, fall into one of two categories. </p>
<p>In the first category are those who are initially off track with what they planned but later correct themselves, get back on track and go on to complete their life task. To give an example, perhaps someone with lucidity in the intermissive period who had already been a doctor in previous lives, planned to become a plastic surgeon in his forthcoming life to help underprivileged people with physical deformities. Let’s say that  the  person  was  then  born  in  the  US  and  trained  to  become  a plastic surgeon but was seduced by the money to be made in cosmetic surgery  and  established  a  thriving  business  and  comfortable  life  for himself  in  Los  Angeles.  So  he  dedicates  himself  to  consumerism  for several years and is off track with what he planned. At some point, however, something happens to make him question his choices in life. </p>
<p>He  undergoes  an  internal  renovation  that  then  brings  about  an external shift in the form of a new career. He joins Doctors Without Borders  and  spends  the  rest  of  his  professional  life  traveling  third-world countries, using his skills as a plastic surgeon to help alleviate, <a id="p163"></a>the suffering of poor people born with deformities and victims of war and genocide. </p>
<p>For some people in a situation such as this, reprioritizing their life to  give  proper  attention  to  their  life  plan  can  be  a  huge  challenge. </p>
<p>Perhaps  by  the  time  they  realize  they  need  to  make  changes,  they already  have  commitments  in  the  form  of  partners  who  have  no interest  in  improving  themselves,  children  who  take  up  all  of  their time, or a job that is not ethical. So some of the changes they make to get back on track with what they planned, both internal and external, can  be  quite  extreme.  But  at  the  moment  a  person  decides  to rearrange his life and prioritize his inner reform, he will attract the attention  of  helpers  who  will  come  to  assist,  so  he  is  by  no  means alone in his endeavors. </p>
<p>In general, individuals in this category are more influenced by their environment and genetics than by their paragenetics. </p>
<p>In  the  second  category  are  those  people  who  are  never  off  track with what was planned but are very clear about what they want to do from  a  young  age.  They  prioritize  their  lives  to  facilitate  the accomplishment  of  their  purpose  in  life  and  start  fulfilling  it  before the age of 35. </p>
<p>People  like  this  know  what  they’re  supposed  to  be  doing  from adolescence. They already have some awareness of their intermissive period and of a “mission” in life as these realities are still “fresh” so they  start  looking  for  answers,  planning  their  lives  and  giving assistance to others before reaching adulthood. They probably know what their profession should be and choose something that will both enable them to help more people and provide them with the financial security necessary to support their own development. </p>
<p>When  such  people  make  the  major  decisions  about  life  such  as choosing  a  partner  or  deciding  if  they  want  to  have  children,  they invert the tendencies and norms that society imposes on us and end up  with  fewer  commitments  that  prevent  them  from  pursuing  their life  plan.  For  example,  rather  than  living  solely  to  become  parents, they prefer to develop their psychism, master their energies and work with polykarma. So these individuals don’t adopt society’s values and this is because the influence of their paragenetics is stronger than the influence of their environment. </p>
<p><a id="p164"></a>People  who  fall  into  the  latter  category  have  a  greater  chance  of completing  their  life  plan  than  those  in  the  former,  but  what  is important is not when you gain awareness of your purpose in life, but whether or not you fulfill it. In one of his books entitled  <i>Our Evolution</i>, Vieira  describes  the  successful  completion  of  one’s  life  task  as  “the greatest triumph of the human consciousness.” </p>
<p><b>Ten Reasons We Fail to Complete Our Life Plan</b></p>
<p>When we are sidetracked from our evolution and the execution of our life  plan  was  not  satisfactory,  we  often  experience  a  kind  of indefinable discomfort or frustration with life. </p>
<p>Some  life  plans  are  not  accomplished  because  the  person  died prematurely. But the majority of people with a life plan fail to execute it  for  other  reasons.  It  is  roughly  estimated  that  only  a  quarter  of people  who  have  a  life  plan,  be  it  mini  or  maxi,  manage  to  fully complete it. This is not altogether surprising when we consider all the sources  of  opposition  and  interference,  both  internal  and  external. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at ten of the major culprits. </p>
<p><b>Reference Points and Conditionings</b></p>
<p>Society  and  our  external  environment  in  general  pressure  us  with strong  ideas,  assumptions  and  expectations.  Most  wealthy  western societies are conditioned towards robotic, routine behavior lacking in self-awareness. Their references points for success are material wealth, professional  status,  marriage  and  children,  thus  the  self-propagating cycle of the nine to five, the mortgages, the prestigious schools, the holidays, and so on it goes. </p>
<p><b>Perspective</b></p>
<p>A perspective of existence that focuses only on physical life and fails to  include  multidimensional,  multiexistential  realities  such  as energetic fields, past lives, future lives and karma. </p>
<p><b>Emotionality</b></p>
<p>Emotionality  usually  has  the  effect  of  clouding  our  rationality  and diminishing the clarity and serenity of our decisions. </p>
<p><b>Relationships</b></p>
<p><a id="p165"></a>Partners  who  are  skeptical  of  or  oppose  the  idea  that  we  are  more than the physical body. </p>
<p><b>Physical Intrusion</b></p>
<p>Sometimes  our  families  or  partners  henpeck  and  pressure  us  to  do what they want, e.g. run the family business, have children, etc. Are the  members  of  your  evolutionary  group  helping  you  or  preventing you from achieving your life plan? Remember, some of our intruders are not extraphysical. </p>
<p><b>Extraphysical Intrusion</b></p>
<p>And then there are those who are. Many life plans with great potential for productivity are thwarted by extraphysical intrusion. In most cases this  happens  because  people  are  both  unaware  of  the  process  of intrusion and don’t know how to deintrude themselves. </p>
<p><b>Extraphysical Blind Guides</b></p>
<p>Other extraphysical interference can come in the form of blind guides who prefer us to mimic past lives—to live the same kind of life and do the same things that we did together with them in our past. </p>
<p><b>Self-Mimicry</b></p>
<p>Yet often we need no encouragement from our blind guides. We want to mimic our past because we prefer to do what’s easy and what we know rather than face the unknown. </p>
<p><b>Procrastination and Postponement</b></p>
<p>These are the scourges of existential completism. </p>
<p><b>Lack of Motivation</b></p>
<p>A lack of motivation for inner reform is an internal problem, one that comes from inside of us. If we are looking for excuses not to carry out our life plan and to have a calm, comfortable life instead, they’re easy to  find.  The  bottom  line  is  that  many  people  make  excuses  because they’re unwilling to pay the price of evolution—and there is a price to pay. My own experience of attempting to fulfill what I understand to be my purpose in life is that it requires effort, tenacity and sacrifice, and  is  full  of  challenges.  But  when  the  going  gets  tough  I  remind myself  that  my  interest  in  fulfilling  my  purpose  in  life  is  not <a id="p166"></a><img src="index-166_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p>conditional on it being easy and I just keep going. </p>
<p>To explain this another way, take a look at the diagram opposite. </p>
<p>The dot in the center of the inner circle is the consciousness and the inner circle is the comfort zone. When we live life within our comfort zone we experience lower levels of stress, conflict, challenge and risk but there are still problems. We may feel frustration, disappointment and even angst because we are off track with our life plan. So while life  is  manageable  in  the  comfort  zone  it  is  ultimately  unfulfilling, because there is no growth at this level. </p>
<p><b>Comfort zone and security zone (Santos, 2003)</b></p>
<p>The  next  ring  out  is  the  security  zone.  Although  life  here  doesn’t demand anything of us that’s beyond our capacity, we are faced with and  have  to  handle  complex  situations.  Life  is  more  stressful  and unpredictable, but we are happy because we are on track with what we  planned.  Realistically,  we  can’t  expect  to  evolve  without  stress, because  if  there’s  no  stress  we’re  not  being  challenged  or  stretched. </p>
<p>We should aim to live our lives at the outermost edge of the security zone; in other words, at the very limit of our capacities, because this is  where  evolution  takes  place.  So  the  question  you  need  to  ask yourself  is,  what  price,  if  any,  are  you  prepared  to  pay  for  your evolution? </p>
<p><a id="p167"></a>These are ten examples of the more common sources of interference that prevent people from successfully executing their mission in life. </p>
<p>At a certain point in time, the helpers recognized just how difficult it  was  even  to  remember  one’s  life  plan  in  physical  life,  let  alone execute it. So, in the same way that we are here, learning about other dimensions  and  studying  the  evolution  of  the  consciousness,  the helpers  developed  a  course  in  which  lucid   <i>extraphysical</i> consciousnesses  study  the  physical  dimension  and  evolution  during the period between lives, with the objective of successfully executing their  life  mission  in  the  forthcoming  physical  life.  This  course  is known as the intermissive study course. </p>
<p><b>The Intermissive Study Course</b></p>
<p>As  I  mentioned  in  <a href="index_split_000_split11.html#p58">chapter  3, </a>  the  helpers  have  different  areas  of specialty  or  expertise.  The  helpers  who  oversee  the  intermissive course, known as evolutionary orientors, are experts in evolution, are more advanced in terms of evolution than most other helpers and are the mentors of the helpers of our evolutionary group. </p>
<p>During the intermissive course, evolutionary orientors and helpers give  a  series  of  theoretical  and  practical  classes  on  subjects  such  as multidimensional  self-awareness,  seriality,  life  plan,  hindrances  to evolution  in  the  physical  dimension,  free  will,  the  practice  of  lucid projection, bioenergy, polykarma, retrocognitions and cosmoethics. It is  quite  obvious  then  why  those  of  you  who  have  attended  an intermissive  course  will  feel  a  sense  of  affinity  with  the  ideas discussed in this book. </p>
<p>While  intermissive  study  courses  are  accessible  to  all consciousnesses  who  are  motivated  to  attend,  there  are  some commonsense prerequisites for joining. To be eligible you must have</p>
<p>•    passed  through  the  second  death  and  recovered  extraphysical lucidity, i.e. realized you are no longer alive in the physical sense, or in the event that you died as a child, you must have recovered the condition of extraphysical adulthood; </p>
<p>•    acquired  some  multidimensional  experience,  e.g.  accept existential seriality as a reality; </p>
<p>•  and already achieved a reasonable evolutionary level. </p>
<p><a id="p168"></a><b>How Our Life Plan Is Decided</b></p>
<p><b>Optimizing Opportunities for Evolution</b></p>
<p>As  mentioned  at  the  start  of  this  chapter,  assuming  we  are  lucid during  the  period  between  lives,  we  can  participate  in  the  analysis and  planning  of  our  forthcoming  physical  life.  We  do  this  in conjunction with a team of extraphysical helpers who map out its key themes.  The  evolutionary  orientor  of  our  karmic  group  will  make some final suggestions on the plan that we will most likely accept. </p>
<p>Of  course  the  key  consideration  that  is  taken  into  account  when putting  together  the  life  plan  relates  to  the  conditions  that  will optimize our evolution. Who will be the most suitable parents for us, can  they  provide  us  with  a  decent  education,  which  potential  life partners can support and assist us in our goals, what nationalities and cultures can provide conditions that are appropriate and optimal for us? </p>
<p>Often  the  evolutionary  orientor  gives  us  two  or  three  options  of where and to whom we could be born (he may even get involved in creating some synchronicities that allow our future parents to meet if they  haven’t  already),  and  then  we  can  choose  the  option  that  we want. But while you might choose, say, option A as it will provide you with  an  opportunity  to  address  certain  aspects  of  your  development that  you  think  should  be  prioritized,  the  evolutionary  orientor  may bring  other  points  to  your  attention  that  you  didn’t  think  were  so important  and  would  be  best  addressed  by  option  B.  So  while  he doesn’t impose anything on you—the decisions are primarily yours—</p>
<p>he is there to help you to see the bigger picture. </p>
<p><b>Matching Skills with Needs</b></p>
<p>Another strategy he uses to help formulate our life plan is an analysis of our strong and weak traits, as he aims to match up our skills with our own individual needs, with the needs of our group and with those of humankind. For example, some instructors and volunteers involved in  conscientiology  around  the  world,  rather  than  waiting  for  their next intermissive period to start planning their next life, are already anticipating future lives in China. There are some parallels between the Chinese culture and conscientiology, particularly with respect to the  understanding  of  bioenergy.  These  individuals  would  be  able  to, <a id="p169"></a>assist  in  China  by  providing  a  more  updated,  scientific  context  for some of their cultural aspects, and in so doing, help China to bridge to the West at a time when it will arguably be the dominant power on the planet. </p>
<p><b>Evolutionary Partners</b></p>
<p>Something  of  great  interest  to  many  people  actively  pursuing  a  life plan is to identify the person that they planned to spend their life with (if they are not already with that person). But just like the life plan itself, the evolutionary partnership we planned is not  <i>destined</i> to be, as such.  In  most  instances,  several  sets  of  potential  partnerships  will have  been  identified.  Partner  A  (for  want  of  a  better  expression)  is usually the person who will most optimize the opportunities for your evolution  and  is  also  the  person  with  whom  you  would  share  the highest  level  of  spontaneous  love,  intimacy  and  connection.  If unexpected  events  or  circumstances  prevent  you  from  meeting  your partner A (e.g. he or she dies in a car accident while still a teenager) or you don’t connect with this person as planned, the helpers will try to  arrange  for  you  to  meet  your  partner  B,  C  or  D,  etc.  As  you  can imagine, this can require a lot of work on their behalf. </p>
<p>To explain how our evolutionary partner is selected, the partnership itself  is  one  that  lives  in  coherence  with  the  fact  that  we  are  more than  just  the  physical  body;  it  focuses  on  and  prioritizes  the accomplishment of the life task of each partner, and it achieves results in terms of the evolution of both partners. </p>
<p>So our partner in evolution is an individual who helps us to</p>
<p>•  fulfill our purpose in life, </p>
<p>•  analyze our strong and weak traits, </p>
<p>•  become more mature and cosmoethical, </p>
<p>•  become more willing and able to help others, </p>
<p>•  master our energies, </p>
<p>•  develop our psychism, </p>
<p>•    and  become  more  aware  of  the  multidimensional  and multiserial aspects of existence. </p>
<p>And you do the same for them. In time, you share substantial areas of, <a id="p170"></a>each other’s life plans and you support each other in their execution. </p>
<p>It  is  important  to  understand  however  that  the  evolutionary partnership is not a type of utopia in which all relationship problems are resolved. Challenges will always be faced when one is consciously trying to evolve. </p>
<p><b>Finding Your Evolutionary Partner</b></p>
<p>Perhaps you are already with your evolutionary partner, or perhaps you recognize that the person you are with is not supportive of your efforts to grow and evolve, or even prevents you from accomplishing what  you  planned.  Or  maybe  you  are  single.  If  you  are  looking  for your  evolutionary  partner,  the  important  thing  to  remember  is  that common underlying feelings  and  ideas  will  always  draw  likeminded people  together.  Living  your  life  in  coherence  with  the  ideas associated with the evolutionary partnership will cause you to shine energetically  and  create  synchronicities  that  facilitate  you  meeting others who share similar broad goals. </p>
<p><b>Moratoriums</b></p>
<p>When a person was supposed to die (e.g. jumps out of a plane and his parachute fails to open at 8000 ft.) and receives an extension of life (e.g. lands in a haystack thick enough to cushion his fall), sometimes this is referred to as a moratorium, meaning the person was granted a kind of reprieve  from death.  Sometimes a  person  is granted  what  is known  in  conscientiology  as  an  existential  moratorium,  which  is  an extension  of  physical  longevity  granted  for  the  specific  purpose  of allowing more time to accomplish part of or to complete a life plan. </p>
<p>Again, it is the evolutionary orientor who is responsible for such an intercession. A near-death experience (NDE) in which a person meets his  orientor  and  obtains  information  that  prompts  an  evolutionary crisis that results in significant changes to his life is an example of an existential moratorium. This can happen when a person is sidetracked from his life plan. </p>
<p>There are two types of existential moratoriums. </p>
<p><b>Minor Existential Moratorium</b></p>
<p>A minor existential moratorium is when a person was going to die but is given more time to complete his life plan regardless of whether it’s, <a id="p171"></a>a  mini  or  a  maxi.  Nominated  for  a  Nobel  Peace  Prize  in  1998  and highly  regarded  as  a  man  of  forgiveness,  tolerance,  peace  and compassion,  it  seems  likely  that  the  late  King  Hussein  of  Jordan received  several  minor  moratoriums  to  allow  him  further opportunities  to  complete  a  maxi  life  plan—to  broker  peace  in  the Middle East. To quote a book about his life written by his fourth wife, Queen Noor, “Attempts on King Hussein were the stuff of legend.” At the  age  of  16,  he  survived  the  first  attempt  on  his  life  (the  first  of more  than  ten,  and  the  same  one  in  which  his  grandfather  King Abdullah was assassinated) when the bullet aimed at his chest hit a medal  that  his  grandfather  had  insisted  he  wear  that  morning.  He went on to survive an air ambush by Syrian MiG jets, road ambushes, attempts to poison his food and nose drops, wars with various Arab neighbors and invasions by the PLO. He fought off coup attempts and overcame  renal  cancer  in  1992  before  finally  succumbing  to  non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 1999. (Queen Noor, 2005)</p>
<p><b>Major Existential Moratorium</b></p>
<p>A  major  existential  moratorium  is  when  a  person  has  successfully accomplished a maxi life plan and was going to die but merits and is given new tasks by the evolutionary orientor and additional time to execute them. In such cases, the helpers may sponsor “renovations” to the person’s physical body to support the moratorium. </p>
<p><b>Melancholy and Euphoria Related to Failure or Success in One’s Life Plan</b></p>
<p>When people are off track with their life plan they sometimes become melancholic,  without  knowing  why.  An  imprecise  malaise  that  they can’t quite put their finger on settles in their gut and life feels empty and unfulfilling. Failure to complete the life plan sometimes manifests therefore as depression or even as a mid-life crisis—for what is a mid-life crisis but an intangible sense of having failed? </p>
<p>Do  you  know  any  cantankerous  old  people  who  are  “glass  half empty”  pessimistic?  This,  too,  can  be  a  common  manifestation  of melancholy  associated  with  the  realization  that  one  has  led  a superficial existence and done little of value—and in the case of the aged, one that is further exacerbated by the knowledge that it’s too late to start over. </p>
<p><a id="p172"></a>What  about  you?  If  you  died  right  now  would  you  feel  satisfied with what you have accomplished so far? </p>
<p>Melancholy related to the unsuccessful execution of one’s life plan can  also  be  experienced  after  death,  particularly  by  those  who  are more lucid. This is known as extraphysical melancholy. </p>
<p>If you have a life plan, your evolutionary orientor may sponsor a panoramic  review  of  your  life  after  your  death  so  you  can  analyze, evaluate and learn from your performance with his guidance, and also understand  that  your  every  thought,  action  and  inaction  had consequences for others. </p>
<p>How do you think you would you feel if, during your life review, you saw that you had all the opportunities, resources and contacts to successfully  execute  your  life  plan  but  you  got  off-track  and  failed? </p>
<p>This  is  what  causes  extraphysical  melancholy.  This  is  a  particularly distressing  condition  to  be  in,  as  we  know  that  not  only  through making inappropriate choices did we miss opportunities to evolve, but that those opportunities can never be recovered. </p>
<p>On the other hand, when you know you are on track with your life plan you can feel euphoric. You are aware of your plan, you know you can accomplish it, you are filled with the strength and energy to do so and you are motivated to advance further in the next life. It is normal that you will also encounter problems and challenges because this is the nature of evolution, but they don’t get you down. </p>
<p>You  can  also  experience  euphoria  after  death—extraphysical euphoria. You look back on your life with the evolutionary orientor, and seeing that you managed to accomplish your life plan as intended, you feel a deep and abiding sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. </p>
