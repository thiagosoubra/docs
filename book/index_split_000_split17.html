<p>Retrocognitions</p>
<p>In  conscientiology,  just  as  in  archeology,  we  do  not  excavate  the past  with  pickaxes  or  explosives,  but  with  tweezers,  a  brush,  and patience. </p>
<p> <i>—Wagner Alegretti</i></p>
<p>Mahatma  Gandhi  once  said,  “It  is  nature’s  kindness  that  we  do  not remember  past  births.  Life  would  be  a  burden  if  we  carried  such  a tremendous  load  of  memories.”  In  many  ways,  I  concur  with  this statement. Think of the feuds, grudges, quarrels, disputes and rivalries that  would  reignite  every  time  you  reencountered  an  enemy  from your past. Think of the regrets, guilt, shame, obsessions and passions that would plague you. Much of the karma we have with those closest to  us  would  never  be  resolved  if  we  all  carried  baggage  that  we’d brought from past lives with us. The fact that we recommence each physical life with the memory slate wiped clean, so to speak, provides us  with  opportunities  to  reestablish  old  relationships  from  a  fresh perspective and to settle some karmic issues. </p>
<p>Nonetheless,  there  is  much  of  value  to  be  learned  from remembering  our  past  lives  and  anyone  with  the  interest, multidimensional  self-awareness  and  willingness  to  devote  the  time and effort required to recover memories of their past, stands to greatly benefit from this fascinating phenomenon. </p>
<p>This  chapter  summarizes  the  research  on  retrocognitions  of conscientiologist  and  author  Wagner  Alegretti,  who  has  been researching  the  projective  experience  and  its  associated  phenomena and implications since 1980. After meeting Vieira in 1982, Alegretti became  a  founding  member  of  the  International  Institute  of Projectiology and Conscientiology (IIPC) in 1988. Several years later, all IIPC offices outside of Brazil formed the International Academy of Consciousness (IAC) of which Alegretti was named, and is at the time of writing, president. </p>
<p><a id="p134"></a>Past-life recall, popularly known as regression, is technically known as  retrocognition,  from  the  Latin   <i>retro</i>  meaning  back  and   <i>cognition</i> meaning  knowledge  or  to  know.  A  retrocognition  therefore,  is  the process  in  which  the  memory  of  any  event  from  one’s  past  lives, including those spent in the extraphysical dimension between lives, is transferred from the mental body of the consciousness to the physical brain, coming into the area of direct awareness of the individual. </p>
<p><b>What Defines a True Retrocognition? </b></p>
<p>As  retrocognitions  are  often  experienced  during  an  altered  state  of consciousness  in  which  there  is  likely  to  be  some  level  of discoincidence between the extraphysical body and the physical body, one  of  the  most  challenging  aspects  of  the  phenomenon  is  knowing how  to  be  sure  that  you’ve  had  a  retrocognition;  in  other  words, knowing how to distinguish the real thing from a dream, a fantasy, or a flashback of a moment in your present life that you had forgotten (e.g.  a  flashback  of  a  film  set  in  an  historical  period  that  you  saw when you were a young child). </p>
<p>According to Alegretti, to be sure that a retrocognition is genuine, you should have at least ten coherent retrocognitions about the same experience.  So  if  you  have  a  recollection  that  you  think  might  be  a retrocognition,  make  note  of  it  in  writing  and  file  it  in  the  “to  be confirmed” folder to await further verification. </p>
<p>Second,  a  true  retrocognition  is  remarkable  for  the  quality  of  the experience in that the minute details of the past event are amplified to the point where you relive it. You are there. You see all the elements that  make  up  the  setting—the  era,  the  culture,  the  location,  the weather;  you  feel  the  emotions;  you  understand  your  relationship with the people around you and perceive the effect they have on you; you  hear  the  sounds  and  music,  the  voices  and  words.  A  real retrocognition  that  brings  all  these  factors  into  play  will  not  be  a mediocre experience but will have impact. It will move you in some way. It is this exceptional intensity of the retrocognitive phenomenon that separates it from a common dream or fantasy. </p>
<p>It  is  also  important  to  note  the  appreciable  differences  between retrocognitions and flashbacks. In flashbacks, you are an observer of a scene in which you are involved, whereas in a retrocognition you are an active participant. People also sometimes confuse retrocognitions <a id="p135"></a>with what they believe to be time-travel. When you are involved in a scene in which you experience the same sensations as being alive in the physical body but you cannot change or affect your thoughts or actions, you are having a retrocognition. </p>
<p>Robert Monroe recounts several episodes in his first book,  <i>Journeys Out of the Body</i>, in which he “took over” the life of and “temporarily displaced” the individuality of another man in a sort of double life led while out of the body in an extraphysical dimension. In this other life, he had an ongoing relationship with a woman and her children, a job and a home, etc. and although he was actively involved in the events that  took  place  there  he  was  unable  to  influence  or  change  what happened in any way. Because of this, it seems probable that Monroe had a series of retrocognitions relating to the same period of his past rather than a double life. </p>
<p>Third,  retrocognitions  often  have  some  connection  to  our  present life, revealing why we have a specific limitation or skill. For example, a  man  who  likes  to  date  several  women  concurrently  might  have  a retrocognition that places him in a culture that permits polygamy. A woman who is bossy, conceited and accustomed to being the center of attention might recall a privileged life as a noble woman or royal. </p>
<p>Retrocognitions  are  also  usually  of  deeply  emotional  moments. </p>
<p>These are the occasions we are most likely to remember from our past as well as our present lives. But don’t expect the memories to come prettily ordered in sequence with the most recent life first. They will be  random  and  may  relate  to  an  intermissive  period  as  well  as  a physical existence. </p>
<p><b>The Benefits of Retrocognitions</b></p>
<p>Beyond satisfying our natural curiosity, retrocognitions can provide us with  important  insights  into  why  we  are  the  way  we  are—why  we suffer from certain limitations, blockages, fears and phobias; why we have  a  particular  Achilles  heel  and  other  weak  traits;  why  we  have remarkable strong traits that have clearly not been inherited from our family and why we are sometimes driven by powerful intuitions that are difficult to rationalize. </p>
<p> <i><b>In  accessing  our  own  personal  historical  files  and  finding  out where  we  have  lived,  who  we  have  been  and  what  we  have accomplished or failed to achieve in past lives, we are presented with  <a id="p136"></a>invaluable opportunities to solve some of the problems and dilemmas we  create  for  ourselves.  In  this  way,  retrocognitions  can  be therapeutic;  curing  or  relieving  some  traumas  and  even  physical illnesses. </b></i></p>
<p>For example, perhaps you have a retrocognition in which you recall being  aboard  a  sinking  ship,  understanding  your  certain  fate  of drowning a terrifying death many long minutes before succumbing to the cold water or sharks. This would explain a phobia of the water or a  fear  of  being  at  sea.  In  a  similar  fashion,  the  trauma  of  a  former death through suffocation or smoke inhalation might manifest in this life as a respiratory illness. </p>
<p>In  instances  such  as  these,  the  retrocognitive  process  allows  the sufferer  to  contextualize  and  isolate  the  trauma,  and  to  consider  it with  the  emotional  balance  that  distance  allows.  This  process  can diminish  the  intensity  of  the  effects  of  the  trauma,  which  in  turn makes it harder for extraphysical intruders (who are attracted by that variety  of  the  energy  that  the  subconscious  memory  produces),  to connect to the individual. </p>
<p>Another tangible benefit of retrocognitions is that they shed a long light of truth on the nature of the past connections or associations we have  had  with  various  people  close  to  us  in  this  life,  offering opportunities  to  “recycle”  relationships  that  have  already  endured over many lives and that will continue on into the future due to the strength  of  the  karmic  links.  In  many  cases,  the  retrocognition  will confront  us  with  the  choice  of  either  repeating  certain  behavioral patterns in our relationships or doing something new. </p>
<p>For example, perhaps a single mother whose possessive son never approves of her choice of partner and sabotages her attempts to find love,  has  a  retrocognition  and  sees  that  she  also  tolerated  his possessiveness  and  interference  in  her  private  life  in  a  previous incarnation, only then their roles were reversed—he was the parent and she was the child. If she understands anything at all about karma, she  can  conclude  that  their  intimate  connection  will  probably  bring them  together  again  in  a  future  life  and  that  unless  she  makes  an effort to change the status quo of their relationship and assert herself now, she will suffer his dominance over her again. </p>
<p>For those who have the maturity to reflect upon the nature of the relationships  they’ve  had  in  the  past  with  people  who  are  close  to <a id="p137"></a>them  today,  a  healthy  dose  of  sincerity  is  required  to  take  best advantage  of  the  opportunities  to  grow  that  are  presented  by retrocognitions.  We  need  to  be  honest  about  the  quality  of  the connections we share with some people. Empathy and understanding for others, and the wisdom and grace to forgive the past will also help create the space necessary for change and for something new to grow. </p>
<p>Although there are a number of benefits to recalling past lives, the greatest  value  is  in  remembering  the  most  recent  period  between lives.  These  periods  are  harder  to  recall  though  because  they  took place in the extraphysical dimension where the existence is a radically different experience to life on earth. We don’t even breathe there. So even former physical lives that occurred 3,000 years in the past are easier  to  recall  than  an  intermissive  period  that  ended  only  a  few decades ago. </p>
<p>A conscious recollection of our last period between lives is such a unique tool for self-knowledge and should be prioritized, because this type of retrocognition might allow us access to the details of the plan for this life that was made for us at that time. Some of us were even involved  in  conceiving  the  plan  for  our  upcoming  physical  life  and agreed  to  it,  prior  to  being  born.  This  life  plan,  task  or  mission  (in other  words,  our  purpose  in  life)  is  an  important  area  of <a href="index_split_002_split1.html#p157">conscientiological research and will be examined in depth in chapter</a></p>
<p><a href="index_split_002_split1.html#p157">10. Recalling what we planned to do in this life can have far-reaching</a></p>
<p>consequences. It enables us to see how and where we waste our time, and may prompt us to reprioritize our lives if necessary, to streamline our  efforts,  energy  and  resources  for  the  accomplishment  of  more worthwhile tasks related to our karmic obligations and to our growth and evolution as consciousnesses. </p>
<p>So  we  can  see  that  the  phenomenon  of  retrocognition  can  be  a catalyst for personal change and growth. It can provide a variety of opportunities  to  overcome  shortcomings,  dissipate  energetic blockages,  heal  psychosomatic  scars,  relieve  some  physical  illnesses, improve our group karma and enhance our self-understanding. </p>
<p><b>Factors That Block and Inhibit Retrocognitions</b> Considering  the  obvious  value  of  the  phenomenon,  it  is  frustrating that it is such an elusive experience, but there are many factors that block and inhibit the retrocognitive process. </p>
<p><a id="p138"></a>The process itself works like this. The physical brain, which is only acquired  by  the  consciousness  at  the  commencement  of  its  current physical life, does not hold any memory of one’s past lives because it didn’t exist then. It is the extraphysical and mental bodies that store the memories of the consciousness, the holomemory being stored in the  mental  body.  So  in  order  for  us  to  access  this  information,  the memories  have  to  be  “downloaded”  from  the  more  subtle  bodies  of manifestation to the physical brain. </p>
<p><b>Low Multidimensional Self-Awareness</b></p>
<p>One of the factors that blocks this process in the majority of people is a  very  low  level  of  multidimensional  self-awareness,  meaning  that most people have no knowledge, direct experience or interest in their own  nonphysical  realities  and  no  motivation  to  learn.  How  can  a woman  preoccupied  solely  with  the  rigors  of  daily  survival,  who believes that after death she will cease to exist, lucidly recall her most recent intermissive period? How can a man concerned only with the accumulation  of  material  wealth  hope  to  discover  the  intricate multiserial path of his existence to date? This is not to say that either of these scenarios is impossible; they are not, but they are unlikely. </p>
<p><b>Lack of Maturity</b></p>
<p>Another factor that impedes the “download” of memories of past lives to the physical brain is lack of maturity. When we look around us it is plain to see that many people can’t even cope with their current life and  regularly  escape  the  disappointment,  tedium  or  stress  of  their reality through drugs, alcohol and medications. If the challenges and demands of this life are too much to deal with, how would these same people cope if they remembered the shames, injustices, sorrows, fears and hardships of previous lives? </p>
<p><b>Some Memories of Past Lives are Blocked to Spare Us Pain</b></p>
<p>In addition, the exposure of the nature of past relationships with those close to us would, in many cases, be too difficult to live with. Could you remain balanced and positive knowing, for example, that one of your relatives was your intruder for several hundred years, or that you once had a sexual relationship with an individual who is a member of your  immediate  family  in  this  life?  In  the  same  way  the  automatic, <a id="p139"></a>mechanism of memory repression sometimes takes over to protect us from reliving the trauma of past events in this life, the consciousness blocks  memories  of  past  lives  to  spare  us  the  pain.  Sometimes  the helpers  also  intervene  to  protect  us  from  the  impact  of  disturbing memories  that  would  have  negative  repercussions  and  they  actively prevent  the  recall  of  certain  lives  or  periods  of  our  past.  They generally allow the recall of milder moments and bring memories in a manageable ascending order of impact. </p>
<p><b>Energetic Blockages</b></p>
<p>Energetic  blockages,  particularly  in  the  frontal  chakra,  which  is located between the eyes, and the crown chakra, which is located at the top of the head, also hinder the flow of information between the nonphysical brain of the extraphysical body and the human brain. The chakras are also responsible for the exchange of energy between the extraphysical  body  and  the  physical  body  so  in  order  for  the information  to  flow  freely,  the  chakras  must  be  open.  A  good technique  for  improving  the  performance  of  these  two  chakras  is called the cranial circuit of energies. It involves exteriorizing energy out through the crown chakra and then absorbing energy through the frontal chakra, exteriorizing again through the crown chakra and so on until you perceive the energy flowing in a circuit. Practice this for 10–15 minutes and then reverse the direction of the flow for another 10–15 minutes. Regular practice and mastery of the vibrational state will also greatly help to reduce energetic blockages in the frontal and crown  chakras  and  facilitate  the  flow  of  information  from  the parabrain to the brain. </p>
<p><b>Poor Physical Memory</b></p>
<p>Poor  physical  memory  can  also  inhibit  lucid  retrocognitions.  If  you can’t even remember what you had for dinner last night, how can you hope to remember lucid projections that you experienced in previous lives? Factors such as stress, a lack of nutrition in the diet and lack of sleep,  as  well  as  the  regular  use  of  drugs  like  alcohol,  tobacco  and marijuana similarly do not favor conscious retrocognitions. </p>
<p><b>The Shock of Rebirth</b></p>
<p>A  major  factor  responsible  for  our  inability  to  recall  our  past  is  the shock  of  rebirth,  which  contrary  to  popular  belief  is  usually  more, <a id="p140"></a>traumatic than the shock of death. When the physical body dies, the consciousness  is  freed  from  the  limitations  of  the  more  restrictive dense  energies  of  the  physical  dimension  and  enters  a  phase  of  its existence where it is more expanded, in which it manifests a greater percentage of its true self. </p>
<p>When  we  are  preparing  to  be  reborn  again,  gestating  in  our mother’s  womb,  the  consciousness  attaches  itself  to  a  body  that  is nothing  more  than  a  collection  of  cells.  When  the  consciousness  is born, there are automatic processes in place for crying, suckling milk and dirtying the diapers, but little else. There is not even a scrap of self-awareness.  The  consciousness  has  to  learn  everything—how  to talk, walk, think, be self-aware, etc. from scratch. Through the process of entering a physical body whose brain is empty and needs to learn everything, the consciousness suffers a massive restriction of lucidity. </p>
<p>This abrupt interruption in the continuity of lucidity is very traumatic and  profoundly  affects  the  consciousness  and  generally  blocks memories of other existences. </p>
<p>These are the main reasons why we don’t remember our past lives. </p>
<p><b>Precautions</b></p>
<p>Before  we  look  at  some  tips  and  techniques  for  overcoming  these blocking  factors  and  producing  retrocognitions,  it  is  important  to mention the following precautions to insure you are well-prepared for the experience and to avoid any negative effects:</p>
<p>•  In dredging up memories of the past you will probably evoke some  extraphysical  consciousnesses  associated  with  the  events recalled, so it’s important to have a good level of energetic self-defense.  This  can  be  achieved  by  working  with  the  vibrational state. </p>
<p>•    Avoid  any  self-intrusions  that  may  be  caused  by  indulging feelings  of  shame  or  guilt,  and  avoid  obsessing  over  past existences. </p>
<p>•  Be mature and discerning about what you tell others about your retrocognitions and who you share your recollections with. </p>
<p>Not everyone will be equipped to handle information about their past so be circumspect about what you tell to whom. And don’t use retrocognitions as a means of seduction. </p>
<p><a id="p141"></a>Although it is possible for several people  who  know  one  another  to each  have  separate,  individual  retrocognitions  of  a  previous  life shared together, participating in group regressions in which everyone is physically together is not advisable, as it is possible to experience a retrocognition  of  another  person  in  these  situations.  While  on  the subject, whether in a group or alone, in general it is not advisable to be  regressed  by  someone  else,  as  hypnosis  can  in  some  cases  be  an invasive mechanism. It should, therefore, be used as a last resort to alleviate or cure a serious problem such as a phobia, for instance, and then,  only  by  an  experienced,  balanced  and  cosmoethical hypnotherapist. To explore our past in search of self-knowledge, we need  to  have  the  tools  in  our  own  hands  and  not  be  dependent  on anyone  else.  The  ideal  is  that  we  learn  to  willfully  self-induce  a retrocognition  through  the  practice  of  a  technique,  or  to  acquire enough  lucidity  of  our  seriality  so  that  retrocognitions  can spontaneously occur while the consciousness is manifesting in either the physical, extraphysical or mental body. </p>
<p>As  a  final  precaution,  don’t  waste  any  information  gained  via successful retrocognitions by repeating the mistakes of your past. </p>
<p><b>Tips for Recalling Past Lives</b></p>
<p>There  are  several  practical  things  you  can  do  to  gain  insights  into your  previous  personalities  and  to  optimize  your  chances  of successfully recalling your past existences, such as the following:</p>
<p>•    Study  the  clues  to  past  lives  mentioned  in  the  previous chapter. Identify your tendencies and preferences and all of the things with which you have an affinity. Take note of how you feel in  certain  cities  and  countries.  Do  you  feel  more  at  home  in  a country  other  than  the  one  in  which  you  were  born?  List  the languages you speak; your hobbies and favorite pastimes; as well as any major illnesses, accidents, patterns of energetic blockages, birthmarks  or  birth  defects,  phobias,  aversions  or  traumas  you have. </p>
<p>•  Identify your physical and emotional Achilles heel. These are your mega-weak traits. Make a list of your other weak and strong traits. The most sincere way of doing this is to ask others to draw up  these  lists  for  you.  And  don’t  ask  only  the  people  who  like you, but also the people who you don’t get along with so well. </p>
<p><a id="p142"></a>These  people  will  likely  be  more  forthcoming  with  their criticisms.  To  achieve  the  best  results,  reassure  everyone  that there will be no repercussions for their brutal honesty. Compare the  lists  and  identify  where  the  consensus  lies.  Any  incorrect perceptions  you  have  about  yourself  will  be  brought  to  your attention, so this exercise will help you see yourself for who you really are. And who you really are is the result of your past. For example,  are  you  consumed  with  your  own  self-importance,  is your  ego  out  of  control,  can  you  not  accept  someone  else’s authority, do you have a taste for the high life? Chances are you were a leader or held a position of some privilege and power in a previous life. </p>
<p>•  Study closely your immediate and extended family and wider circle  of  friends,  particularly  those  with  whom  you  spend  the most time. These are the members of your groupkarma—people with whom you have already lived many lives. Make note of the type of people you like to have around you. What characteristics distinguish the group? Are they artists, tradesmen, businessmen, intellectuals  or  criminals?  Are  they  altruistic,  hedonistic, materialistic or religious? Are they open-minded or governed by societal  norms?  Studying  your  group  and  the  things  you  do together  you  will  provide  some  clues  to  the  things  you  did together in the past. </p>
<p>•  Keep a diary in which you record your projections, episodes of  intrusion,  and  any  psychic  perceptions  such  as  clairvoyance, telepathy or intuition you may have. All these may hold clues to past lives. </p>
<p>•  Train your physical memory so it doesn’t degenerate. Give it a regular workout. Ask your doctor if there are supplements that could improve its performance. </p>
<p>•    Nurture  the  attributes  of  curiosity  and  neophilia.  In  other words, open yourself to new experiences and ideas by traveling to new  places,  talking  to  new  people  and  participating  in  new activities. When you are interested in your life, you observe more, remember  more  and  provide  the  mental  body  with  plenty  of stimulation. </p>
<p>•  Strive to achieve and maintain a good level of emotional stability. </p>
<p>The ideal condition for achieving lucid retrocognitions is one in, <a id="p143"></a>which  we  are  open  and  curious  and  our  rationality  is  more dominant than our emotionality. A good technique for improving emotional  balance  is  to  aim  to  achieve  ten  consecutive  days without having an emotional outburst such as throwing a temper tantrum,  crying  out  of  self  pity,  drinking  too  much  or  getting horribly  depressed.  And  then  try  to  beat  that  record  and  last eleven  days  and  so  on.  If  eventually  you  manage  to  stay emotionally calm for 100 days, or even more, you will see that you are a different person. </p>
<p>•  Exteriorize energies in your bedroom to cleanse and improve the  quality  of  the  energetic  field  and  to  create  the  protective shield that was explained in <a href="index_split_000_split12.html#p78">chapter 4</a>. This will facilitate quality sleep, which is important, as a lack of it can block our memory. </p>
<p><b>Techniques for Producing Retrocognitions</b></p>
<p>Beyond  these  practical  tips  for  optimizing  our  chances  of  recalling past  lives,  there  are  several  techniques  for  producing  lucid retrocognitions that are known to work. Although success cannot be guaranteed,  anyone  with  the  motivation,  determination  and  will  to succeed can achieve positive results. </p>
<p>•  Try to increase the quantity and lucidity of your out-of-body experiences. As the memories of our past lives are stored in the mental body and the parabrain of the extraphysical body, we can more  readily  access  this  information  when  the  consciousness manifests directly in these vehicles of manifestation, as happens during an OBE or during other altered states of consciousness in which  the  extraphysical  body  is  partially  separated  from  the physical  body,  such  as  the  hypnagogic  and  hypnopompic  states (the  period  between  wakefulness  and  sleep  and  vice  versa, respectively). </p>
<p>•  Choose meeting one of your helpers outside of the body as a target  for  a  conscious  projection.  Ask  him  something  specific about  one  of  your  previous  lives.  But  be  responsible  with  your motivation for wanting to know. </p>
<p>•    Another  target  could  be  to  meet  with  the  mentor  of  the helpers  in  your  karmic  group,  the  advanced  extraphysical consciousness with whom you agreed what your purpose in this life  would  be  during  your  last  intermissive  period.  Ask  him  to, <a id="p144"></a>remind you what you agreed if you don’t already know. </p>
<p>•  Or try to project to your extraphysical hometown. There you can meet the extraphysical members of your groupkarma and be reminded of the relationships you have shared in the past. </p>
<p>•  Study some personalities, both contemporary and historical, that interest you and whom you admire. Draw up a list of names and then study each of them to see if you resemble any of them. </p>
<p>If you find someone whose traits are uncannily similar to yours, it is possible that either you were that person or that he or she was a  member  of  your  karmic  group.  Again,  file  the  information  in the “to-be-confirmed” folder, pending further verification. </p>
<p>•  Perform a retrocognitive self-hypnosis. This is how it works. </p>
<p>First, prepare to have a projection. Imagine you’re on the edge of an expanse of lawn. In the middle of the lawn there are a series of steps that lead down into a corridor. Picture yourself slowly and calmly going down the stairs, counting in reverse order as you go, 30, 29, 28, etc., and know that what awaits you at the end of the corridor is your past. Say things to yourself between taking the steps and counting the numbers such as “I am getting closer to a previous  life.”  “My  helpers  will  help  me.”  “I  am  not  afraid.”  “I have  no  anxiety  or  fear.”  “I  will  not  be  surprised.”  “I  will remember  everything  when  I  return.”  You  can  pre-record  the prompts  and  play  them  back  for  a  more  effective  self-hypnosis. </p>
<p>When you reach the end of the corridor you will see many doors on both sides. Use your intuition to select one. Don’t panic if you open the door and are confronted with a scene from your past. </p>
<p>This technique is known to work but it might take some practice to achieve results so be prepared to persist. </p>
<p>•  Experiment in a retrocognitarium such as can be found at the Center for Higher Studies of Conscientiology (CHSC) where Vieira is based at the Iguassu Falls in Brazil. This is a laboratory for self-research  that  has  been  especially  designed  for  producing retrocognitions.  Architectural,  psychological  and  energetic conditions, among other physical and nonphysical elements, have been arranged in such a way as to diminish external interference from the environment and to enhance opportunities for recalling past  lives.  Everyone  is  welcome.  Another  retrocognitarium  is planned for the research campus of the International Academy of, <a id="p145"></a>Consciousness  (IAC)  in  Évoramonte,  Portugal.  Or,  if  you  are sufficiently motivated, you can build your own. </p>
<p>If you devote the time and invest the effort into putting these tips and techniques into practice, and if you persist with your efforts, you will predispose yourself to having retrocognitions. </p>
<p>I  would  like  to  conclude  this  chapter  by  quoting  from  an  essay written by Alegretti whose book,  <i>Retrocognitions: An Investigation into the  Memory  of  Past  Lives  and  the  Period  between  Lives</i>,  I  highly recommend to anyone interested in furthering their knowledge of this subject. </p>
<p> <i><b>The  most  efficient  approach  to  retrocognitions  is:  have  as  many retrocognitions  as  you  can  of  your  past  lives  to  know  what  you should  not  be  doing  again  (negative  repetition),  and  have retrocognitions  of  your  last  period  between  lives  to  know  exactly what you should be doing. In this way you will have a much better chance of taking advantage of the opportunities presented to you by life  for  learning  and  helping  the  evolution  of  others.  (Wagner Alegretti)</b></i></p>
