<p>It  has  now  been  five  years  since  this  book  was  first  published,  in English.  During  this  time  I  left  the  Conscientiocentric  Organization (CO)  with  whom  I  volunteered  in  Europe  for  13  years  to  join  the Brazil-based  Interassistantail  Services  for  the  Internationalization  of Conscientiology  (ISIC).  Sincere  thanks  to  Jeffrey  Lloyd  for  being  a constant  source  of  support  during  this  period  of  change.  I  look forward  to  working  with  he  and  the  ISIC  team  to  create  greater awareness of the Brazil-based COs globally. </p>
<p>Reflecting  on  the  experience  of  writing  and  promoting  this  book, there  were  many  kind  people—colleagues,  family,  friends  and  even strangers—whose  knowledge,  time,  effort,  energy  and  sacrifices inspired me to start the project and bring it to this point where Less Incomplete  is  now  available  in  several  foreign  languages—raising awareness  of  Conscientiology  in  countries  such  as  Turkey,  Romania and  France.  A  special  thank  you  to  Dr.  Waldo  Vieira  (deceased)  for endorsing  the  book  and  to  Patricia  Sousa  and  Rodrigo  Medeiros  for their selfless assistance on so many levels and occasions. </p>
<p>Not  all  of  the  people  who  supported  this  project  are  physical.  I would  like  to  acknowledge  the  nonphysical  Helpers  who  kept  me focused,  determined  and  confident  of  being  able  to  overcome  the challenges  that  inevitably  present  themselves  with  such  a  long-term endeavour.  It  has  been  one  of  the  greatest  privileges  of  my  life  to share  this  unpredictable  but  immensely  rewarding  experience  with them and to develop such a deep level of mutual trust. </p>
<p>I owe a special debt of gratitude to my mother, Julie Gustus, and sister, Maryanne Gustus, for being there for me, unconditionally. </p>
