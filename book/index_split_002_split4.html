<p><a id="p195"></a> <i>Chapter Thirteen</i></p>
<p>Cosmoethics</p>
<p>The highest virtue here may be the least in another world. </p>
<p> <i>—Kahlil Gibran</i></p>
<p>I  begin  this  chapter  by  acknowledging  the  additional,  significant research and development of Vieira’s original ideas on the subject of cosmoethics conducted by Wagner Alegretti. Alegretti offers a course on cosmoethics and many of the ideas he has contributed are explored in this chapter. </p>
<p>Cosmoethics are the very essence of holomaturity. It is our level of cosmoethics that defines our level of holomaturity. As the process of evolution  is  a  function  of  becoming  more  mature,  the  relationship between  cosmoethics  and  evolution  is  a  very  close  one.  In  other words, if we are not cosmoethical we don’t evolve. </p>
<p>If we are going to have lucid OBEs, cosmoethics will help us know how  to  behave  appropriately  everywhere  we  go,  physically  and extraphysically. </p>
<p><b>Ethics Versus Cosmoethics</b></p>
<p>In  order  to  define  cosmoethics,  let  me  first  define  ethics.  Ethics  are standards  of  human  behavior  or  conduct  that  are  acceptable  in  a specific group of people. (Human morals, which are rules of conduct that  set  the  standards  of  right  and  wrong,  come  under  the  broader umbrella of ethics). For example, in the UK it is considered wrong to kill  others  and  wrong  to  walk  around  naked  in  public.  Murder,  we know, is wrong by anyone’s standards. But is walking around naked really such a big deal? Native people living in hot climates all around the world don’t wear clothes because the heat and humidity make it impractical. So while public nudity is morally acceptable in Australian aboriginal  society,  it  is  illegal  in  British  society.  This  example demonstrates the subjective and relative nature of ethics and morals. </p>
<p>They  are  not  absolute,  but  vary  across  environments,  countries, <a id="p196"></a>cultures, religions and politics. </p>
<p>Let’s consider some examples of religious morals. </p>
<p>In  the  Hindu  religion  if  a  woman  is  widowed,  she  has  to  wear  a white sari for the rest of her life, while widows of the Greek Orthodox faith are expected to wear black for up to two years after the death of the spouse. </p>
<p>Polygamy is a normal, accepted part of life in some religions, with various caveats being that limits are imposed on the number of wives a man can take and that if he wishes to have more than one he must be  able  to  afford  to  treat  them  all  equally.  This  same  practice  is known  as  bigamy  by  other  religions  and  is  outlawed  in  many countries,  making  marriage  to  more  than  one  person  at  a  time  a criminal offense. </p>
<p>Another example: in Judaism the laws regarding the preparation of kosher foods prohibit the cooking of meat and dairy foods together; they can’t be served at the same meal, and the utensils and dishes on which they are served must be separated. These rules made a lot of sense when they were created;  at  that  time  the  Jewish  people  were living in the desert without refrigeration, and some dairy foods such as  milk  contain  certain  bacteria  that,  when  mixed  with  meat  and ingested,  can  cause  food  poisoning.  So  the  kosher  tradition  is understandable  in  this  context.  But  today,  thanks  to  refrigeration, there is no problem in storing, preparing, cooking or serving milk and meat together, so the reason for this tradition is now outdated. </p>
<p>There  are  many  such  customs  that  are  no  longer  meaningful, relevant or appropriate in modern society, if indeed they ever were. </p>
<p>For  example,  female  circumcision  is  still  widely  practiced  in  many African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries despite the severe risks it poses  to  the  physical  and  emotional  well-being  of  the  women  who endure it; some societies still condone the so-called crimes of honor; and others still forbid the use of contraception even though the earth cannot sustain its population. </p>
<p> <i><b>Cosmoethics,  on  the  other  hand,  are  a  more  absolute,  universal code of conduct that transcend the subjectivity of religions, politics,  cultures,  countries,  continents,  planets  and  dimensions,  and  are therefore  applicable  and  appropriate  in  all  circumstances,  everywhere we go, both inside and outside of the body. They are a  <a id="p197"></a>set  of  overarching  ethical  ideas  that  reflect  the  real  dynamics  of multidimensional  existence  as  opposed  to  the  relative,  often dogmatic and limiting, morals of human society. </b></i></p>
<p>There are no Ten Commandments for cosmoethics. Instead they are a kind of moral philosophy—a way of thinking that helps us to avoid experiencing  and  causing  unnecessary  suffering.  Unlike  ethics, cosmoethics  are  not  imposed  on  us  via  a  formal  system  of  rules  or laws  so  they  are  less  intrusive  and  allow  us  more  freedom,  but demand, on the other hand, a higher level of personal responsibility. </p>
<p>Let’s now examine the bases that shape the way of thinking behind this  cosmic  code  of  conduct.  The  following  are  guidelines  for cosmoethical behavior:</p>
<p><b>Self-Incorruptibility</b></p>
<p>An  important  part  of  cosmoethics  is  to  live  without  self-corruption. </p>
<p>What is self-corruption? The verb “to corrupt” means to destroy the integrity  of;  to  cause  to  be  dishonest  or  disloyal  (especially  by bribery);  to  lower  morally;  to  mar  or  spoil;  to  infect,  taint  or  make impure.  <i>Self-corruption</i>  then,  is  when  we  lower  our   <i>own</i>  integrity  or morals,  or  betray  our   <i>own</i>  principles  and  knowledge.  We  are  self-corrupt, in other words, when there is no coherency between what we know and what we do. </p>
<p>For example, when my mother was growing up in Australia, people would go to the beach, slather baby oil all over themselves and stay out  in  the  sun  all  day  to  get  a  fabulous  tan,  unaware  of  the  risks involved.  But  nowadays  everyone  knows  this  is  dangerous  and  can cause melanoma, a type of skin cancer. So if we avoid the hottest part of the day by going to the beach early in the morning and later in the afternoon,  and  wear  sun  block  and  a  hat,  then  fine.  But  if  we  stay there all day without any protection, then this is self-corruption. </p>
<p>Imagine  that  you  have  a  very  important  task  in  life  that  you planned to fulfill prior to being born, a plan that involved you helping a lot of other people. You need to live until the age of 80 to complete your task but you die from skin cancer at 40 and all the people you were  supposed  to  assist  missed  out  on  your  help.  If  this  were  to happen to you, when you die and pass to the extraphysical dimension, your helpers will tell you that you failed in your life mission because of a suicide of sorts. The same rationale applies to smoking. Smoking, <a id="p198"></a>is a little bit of suicide every day. </p>
<p>Some  other  examples  of  self-corruptions  are:  participating  in extreme  high-risk  sports;  taking  drugs  as  standard  conduct;  abusing one’s  authority;  not  helping  others;  blaming  others  for  one’s  own mistakes;  gossiping  about  others;  the  “tall  poppy”  syndrome  (i.e. criticizing people who do well instead of admiring them); tolerating abuse  of  any  kind;  manipulating  and  controlling  those  who  are weaker; benefit fraud; failing to pay adequate child support to an ex-spouse; and making donations to charities for tax purposes. </p>
<p>We also find examples of self-corruptions in professions; e.g. priests who  abuse  children,  stockbrokers  who  engage  in  insider  trading, doctors  who  smoke,  dieticians  who  are  obese,  psychologists  who encourage their patients to become dependent on them, AIDS-infected prostitutes who have unprotected sex, fashion designers and magazine editors  who  glamorize  anorexic  models.  All  these  people  are incoherent in their behavior. </p>
<p>Equally, we can be self-corrupted in the things that we omit to do; e.g. we don’t get out of bed in the mornings to help our children get ready for school because we are lazy, we neglect our pets because we are lazy, we don’t exercise because we are lazy! Laziness is the major stumbling block of many people who fail to complete their life task. A lot of people just want an easy life. </p>
<p>So  ask  yourself  what  types  of  self-corruptions  you  are  prone  to. </p>
<p>Some are neatly woven and concealed into the very fabric of our daily lives,  others  occur  only  occasionally.  This  is  a  complex  task  that requires complete sincerity. </p>
<p>The helpers clearly see our self-corruptions. They don’t expect us to be perfect, they are aware that we are fallible and make mistakes; but they do have a problem when they see us behaving in a way that is not coherent with what  <i>we know</i> to be correct. One of the reasons that they  don’t  make  the  mistakes  we  do  is  because  they  are  not  self-corrupt. (Alegretti and Trivellato, 2004)</p>
<p> <i><b>An essential principle of cosmoethics, therefore, is that we have to apply what we know in our daily lives. To know something in theory only is not enough. If we want to evolve, we have to put the theory into practice. Make this a priority in your life. </b></i></p>
<p><a id="p199"></a><b>Conscientiality</b></p>
<p>One of the ways in which we regularly fail to apply what we know in our daily lives is when we forget that we are a consciousness and live our lives as if we are the physical body. </p>
<p>If you have read through this book chapter by chapter, by now you will know that you are much more than just the physical body. You are a consciousness, a multidimensional, multiexistential being whose capacity  to  “be”  transcends  time  and  space.  You  have  already experienced  lives  in  different  cultures,  countries  and  maybe  even planets;  your  future  extends  into  eternity  and  the  cosmos  is  your playground. Conscientiality is to live in a way that is coherent with these facts. </p>
<p>A lot of people are aware of this reality one way or another, but in theory  only.  They  still  behave  like  everyone  else—materialistically. </p>
<p>And materialism is the main cause of lack of human ethics. Nothing tempts people to compromise their ethics more than the promise of a fat  check.  Having  a  lucid  out-of-body  experience  or  near-death experience can have a huge impact on our ethics, because we learn that we continue after death and come to understand that we cannot escape the consequences of our actions. So OBEs often help people to start living their lives more cosmoethically. </p>
<p>So what is your level of conscientiality? How often are you aware of the fact that you are a consciousness? How many hours a day do you spend behaving like a human being? </p>
<p><b>The Law of the “Lesser Evil” </b></p>
<p>The  law  of  the  “lesser  evil”  exemplifies  another  principle  of cosmoethics—the importance of applying flexibility to your thinking and  your  judgments;  the  importance  of  not  being  rigid  in  your morality or ethical standards. </p>
<p>For  example,  many  people  would  agree  that  it’s  wrong  to  hunt animals since we no longer need to kill animals ourselves in order to have meat to eat. This issue is very topical in England right now with the recent ban on the traditional sport of fox hunting having met with powerful resistance. But suppose you go to Africa on vacation, your plane crashes in the jungle and while waiting to be rescued you have to hunt in order to survive. This is better than starving to death, right? </p>
<p><a id="p200"></a>It  is  the  lesser  of  the  two  evils  and  therefore,  acceptable  in  this context. </p>
<p>Other examples of the law of the lesser evil are:</p>
<p>•    controlled  euthanasia  is  better  than  dying  a  slow,  painful, inevitable death</p>
<p>•  amputation is better than death</p>
<p>•  in certain circumstance an abortion may be better than allowing the pregnancy to proceed</p>
<p>•  the confinement of anyone is never ideal, but incarcerating dangerous mentally ill patients, murderers, terrorists and rapists is less bad than putting the public at risk</p>
<p>To decide the “lesser” evil in any given situation, we have to use the attributes  of  our  mental  body—our  discernment,  detachment, rationality  and  logic.  Sometimes  our  physical  instincts,  desires  and needs  are  so  strong  that  they  overwhelm  our  mental  body  and  our discernment deserts us. A desperate need for love or sex, for example, can  cloud  our  judgment  and  cause  us  to  lower  our  standards  to  get what  we  want.  We  also  have  to  consider  the  consequences  of  our decisions in respect of time. The effects of some mistakes can last for lives. And lastly, when deciding the lesser evil, we need to be able to see  all  the  mitigating  and  aggravating  circumstances  between  the right and the wrong. The more lucid you are, the more shades of grey you will be able to see between the black and white. </p>
<p><b>Fraternity</b></p>
<p> <i><b>One of the defining characteristics of the helpers is their high level of fraternity, meaning, to them, everyone matters, even intruders. So a cosmoethical  attitude  is  one  in  which  you  want  the  best  for,  feel affection  for  and  are  ready  to  assist  everyone,  even  your  enemies,  competitors and detractors. </b></i></p>
<p>Pure fraternity requires the capacity to feel the suffering of others. </p>
<p>Not to feel empathy or compassion is a type of energetic blockage. At the other end of the scale, feeling too much can be counterproductive. </p>
<p>I knew a man several years ago who was a kind, generous person with good intentions but I came to understand that he was so energetically sensitive that when his friends were in difficulty he would assimilate all of their emotions, become overwhelmed, and then feel compelled, <a id="p201"></a>to  distance  himself  from  them.  In  terms  of  providing  assistance  to others,  he  was  impotent.  The  challenge  therefore  is  to  be  open  to others  and  to  feel  their  suffering,  but  to  remain  detached,  balanced and serene in order to be able to provide effective help when you are needed. </p>
<p>Above  all,  fraternity  necessitates  action.  It  requires  that  you   <i>do</i> things,  not  just  think  about  doing  things.  And  don’t  underestimate what you can do—think big! How many people can you affect with one action, one activity, or one project—one, ten, one hundred, five hundred? How much more could you accomplish if you worked with a team? The more the better. This is polykarma. </p>
<p>Be aware also that omitting to give assistance when you have the opportunity is not without karmic consequences. Doing nothing does not necessarily equate with being neutral. Failing to help when you can  is  anticosmoethical.  So  when  considering  your  own  level  of fraternity, you need first to ask yourself, what do I  <i>do</i> for others? </p>
<p><b>Thoughts and Intentions</b></p>
<p>Cosmoethics don’t only apply to our actions but also to our thoughts and intentions. </p>
<p>In the extraphysical dimension, the action of thought is more direct than  it  is  in  the  intraphysical  dimension.  In  the  intraphysical dimension  we  can  easily  mask  what  we  really  think.  We  can  have thoughts or ideas but not express them. When projected however, our thoughts are immediately transmitted to others. We might as well be yelling  our  thoughts  extraphysically.  As  a  result,  our  helpers  and intruders will always know what we’re really thinking, so we should always  be  honest  with  ourselves  and  be  aware  of  the   <i>real</i>  intention behind  everything  that  we  do.  Ask  yourself,  “What  is  my  real intention here? What do I really want? What outcome am I hoping to procure?” </p>
<p>It’s good to create healthy thinking habits, to practice what we call "mental hygiene” both intraphysically and extraphysically. </p>
<p>So what about our thoughts? Are they cosmoethical? For example, what  about  sexual  fantasies?  Are  they  right  or  wrong?  What  if  a person is between relationships for a period of time or his partner is away  and  he  indulges  in  a  sexual  fantasy  as  an  exception  conduct? </p>
<p><a id="p202"></a>Even in these mitigating circumstances, a sexual fantasy about a real person  is  not  just  a  thought,  it’s  also  an  action.  When  we  fantasize about  someone,  we  send  energy  to  that  person  and  we  end  up connecting a type of energetic duct to them from which we also get something back. So unless the object of our desire is our partner, we are behaving like intruders. When we engage in sexual fantasies, we also call the attention of extraphysical consciousnesses who share our desires,  so  a  lot  of  people  feel  uncomfortable  afterwards  because  of the bad company they have attracted. </p>
<p>If we don’t know about the energetic mechanisms behind fantasies, then we don’t know the consequences for us and for the object of the fantasy, so this is not a self-corruption. But in our case, knowing what we  now  know,  the  least  bad  is  that  the  object  of  our  fantasy  be someone  that  we  create  with  our  imagination  rather  than  a  real person. This will still attract some extraphysical consciousnesses but at least we are not intruding on anyone. </p>
<p>Another thing to be aware of regarding our thoughts is that some of us  will  have  been  leaders  in  previous  lives.  If  this  is  your  case  you may  have  blind  guides  around  you  who  were  once  your  supporters and  who  still  think  of  you  as  their  leader.  So  be  careful  of  wishing revenge on anyone or for anything bad to happen to others because some of your blind guides may rush to carry out your thoughts. </p>
<p>The  key  thing  to  remember  is  that  when  we  are  always cosmoethical  in  our  thoughts,  intentions  and  actions,  the  intruders have fewer means of connecting with us. </p>
<p><b>Personal Principles</b></p>
<p>As well as having the above guidelines to follow, it is also a good idea to  develop  your  own  set  of  personal  principles,  a  kind  of  internal constitution, to help you be more cosmoethical on a day-to-day basis, in all the little things that you do. Here are some examples of what I mean:</p>
<p>•    Think  about  leaving  every  place  that  you  visit  better  off energetically. I’m not talking about public places, because as we saw in <a href="index_split_000_split12.html#p78">chapter 4</a> you should not just go around giving out energy in places where there is bound to be a lot of intrusion, as you will attract  intruders  to  you.  I’m  talking  here  about  the  homes  of friends  or  family  that  you  may  visit.  Exteriorize  your  best, <a id="p203"></a>energies there, infused with your best thoughts and sentiments, as an  anonymous  gesture  to  improve  people’s  energetic environments a little bit. If you stay at someone’s house overnight or longer, there are many other things you can also do to leave it better for your presence—help a child with his homework, offer to prepare a meal, energize a sick plant, make a new toy for the cat,  etc.—so  think  about  how  you  can  help  and  contribute everywhere you go. </p>
<p>•    Remember  that  insisting  on  anything  too  much,  trying  to influence  others  too  much  or  convincing  anyone  of  anything  is intrusion. </p>
<p>•  Don’t allow yourself to get drawn into the same fights and arguments with the same people over and over again. This is a waste  of  your  valuable  time  and  energy.  If  someone  constantly antagonizes  you  into  participating  in  a  fight,  there  is  a  simple solution  for  dealing  with  him.  Tell  him  to  go  to  hell  and  walk away. </p>
<p>•    Make  your  own  decisions.  Know  your  mind  and  be  self-confident even if no one agrees with you. </p>
<p>•  Respect the free will of others. </p>
<p>•  Respect the evolutionary level of others. An example of this is, don’t say more to people about the subjects in this book than people can handle. Those who have not attended the intermissive study course will find it hard to understand about consciousness, energies, evolution, intruders and helpers, so trying to force these ideas on such people is a kind of evolutionary rape. Whatever the person is capable of understanding, explain, but don’t go further. </p>
<p>This is cosmoethical. You will sense energetically when you have crossed the line. </p>
<p>•  Don’t tell people when they are intruded. Most people aren’t strong enough to cope with that. </p>
<p>•  Don’t use your energies to try to change people. In this case, the  intention  may  be  good  but  the  execution  is  not.  (Alegretti, 2002)</p>
<p>To  conclude  this  chapter,  it’s  important  to  explain  the  relationship between  cosmoethics,  karma  and  evolution  as  an  understanding  of</p>
<p><a id="p204"></a><img src="index-204_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p>how these relationships work, enables us to see clearly how we can assume a greater level of responsibility for our evolution. </p>
<p>Take a look at this diagram. </p>
<p><b>Evolutionary process</b></p>
<p>It  shows  that  one’s  level  of  cosmoethics  dictates  one’s  karma,  and karma,  being  the  law  of  cause  and  effect,  dictates  one’s  level  of evolution. </p>
<p>Let me give an example of how this can work. The more you help others,  the  better  your  karma  will  be.  Think  about  all  the  different ways you can help, big and small, and don’t only provide assistance when you are obliged to, but also spontaneously, because you want to. As much as you can, help in ways that clarify rather than simply console—teaching  others,  explaining  how  things  work,  using  your experience to help others to help themselves—this is the best kind of assistance and it will give you great pleasure, too. A life full of good works of assistance to others will obviously have a positive effect on your karma. How might this good karma unfold? It might mean that you are born to a couple in your next life who completely master their energies. Imagine if as a baby your parents taught you how to move your energies in the same way that they taught you how to walk! How proficient would you be by the time you were ten? What would your level  of  energetic  self-defense  be  like,  how  advanced  would  your parapsychism  be,  how  easily  would  you  be  able  to  leave  the  body, how unblocked would your chakras be? </p>
<p>So can you see, the better your karma is, the better your evolution? </p>
<p>The  more  we  know  about  cosmoethics  and  about  ourselves  as consciousnesses, the faster we can evolve. </p>
