<p><a id="p245"></a>Conclusion</p>
<p>What we have to learn to do, we learn by doing. </p>
<p> <i>—Aristotle (384–322 BC)</i></p>
<p>Every day we all have experiences that tell us that we are so much more than just the human body. In this book I have summarized the bases of the sciences of conscientiology and projectiology that allow us to try to better understand the mechanisms behind these events. In arriving  at  a  more  comprehensive,  inclusive  and  realistic understanding  of  life,  we  can  begin  the  process  of  consciously  and proactively engaging with the unseen, although very real, aspects of existence that exert such significant influence over our lives. </p>
<p>While this book focuses on the benefits for the individual—of living life  consistent  with  the  fact  that  we  are  a  consciousness  with  the inherent  capacity  to  transcend  our  physicality—it  is  worth  taking  a moment here to consider the implications of applying this knowledge on a collective level. </p>
<p>Consider this—if the life you are living as an individual is largely the result of your personal level of holomaturity and your holokarma, then  the  conditions  and  circumstances  we  experience  globally  are similarly a reflection of the level of holomaturity and the holokarma of human society as a group. In other words, we are not the victims of global  warming  and  its  associated  meteorological,  ecological  and economic  disasters;  we  are  not  the  victims  of  abject  poverty,  of famine,  homelessness,  of  depression,  addiction,  obesity  and innumerable other  health epidemics;  we are  not  the victims  of  war, terrorism and violence motivated by racial hatred, religious fanaticism and  other  forms  of  segregation.  These  issues  and  many  others  are, rather, the harvest of seeds that as a group we have sown in the past. </p>
<p>So the broadest use of conscientiology and projectiology is to show us that the way forward both as individuals and collectively is to take responsibility  for  all  of  our  actions  and  inactions  and  to  focus  on evolving  by  increasing  our  personal  level  of  maturity  and cosmoethics, a process that intrinsically requires assisting others to do, <a id="p246"></a>the same. As Mahatma Gandhi once said, “Be the change we want to see in the world.” </p>
