<p><a id="p205"></a>PART FOUR</p>
<p>The Out-of-Body Experience</p>
<p>By  far,  the  most  difficult  and  impressive  part  of  projection  is  the moment of lucid take-off from the waking state. There is no animic or psychic phenomenon that provides a greater impact. It is the one event able to provoke modification of scientific, moral and religious points  of  view,  and  has  deep  far  reaching  effects  on  anyone’s knowledge,  opinions,  education,  customs  and  beliefs.  Upon experiencing  the  lucid  takeoff  …  generations  of  teaching  are humbled, centuries of civilizations are reduced to dust in the mind of  the  projector,  and  mountains  of  prejudice  lose  their  meaning. </p>
<p>Through  personal  experimentation,  one  dismisses  all  tiresome arguments. The result is peaceful certainty. </p>
<p> <i>—Waldo Vieira</i></p>
<p>The  objective  of  this  final  part  of  the  book  is  to  provide  you  with information  that  will  help  you  produce  your  own  lucid  out-of-body experiences  in  a  composed,  relaxed  and  confident  manner;  to  recall them and to accurately distinguish them from a range of other altered states of consciousness and paranormal phenomena. </p>
<p>These  experiences  will,  in  turn,  enable  you  to  verify  the  material presented in this book for yourself. </p>
