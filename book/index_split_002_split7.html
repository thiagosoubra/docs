<p>Preparation for the Out-of-Body Experience</p>
<p>Research  has  shown  that  a  number  of  factors  relating  to  how  we prepare  ourselves  for  a  projection  during  the  physical  waking  state prior to a projection can facilitate our level of lucidity while outside the  body  and  enhance  the  recall  of  the  experience  upon  returning. </p>
<p>Having  said  that,  all  the  preparations  we  make  to  project  are optimizations  only,  meaning  that  a  lucid  projection  can  also  occur even if we do no preparation at all. </p>
<p>Following is a list of variables, drawn from Vieira’s research, that can influence the level of success of our projections. I recommend that you use it as a checklist in preparation for every attempt to leave the body. </p>
<p><b>External Factors</b></p>
<p>Logically, the very first thing we need to decide prior to attempting to project  is  where  we  are  going  to  “park”  the  physical  body.  As  the physical body will be asleep when we are projected, we need to leave it in a safe and comfortable location in which we have the greatest level  of  control  over  external  factors  such  as  temperature,  heating, lighting, noise level and privacy. For most of us, this place will be our bedroom. </p>
<p><b>Temperature</b></p>
<p>The  ideal  temperature  is  one  that  will  prevent  the  body  from becoming  too  hot  or  too  cold  throughout  the  duration  of  the experience, and thus, from calling the extraphysical body back to the physical body. Anything at all that calls attention to the physical body will  cause  a  projection  to  end,  so  you  must  be  comfortable  at  all times.  When  we  are  too  hot,  we  become  mentally  sluggish,  which reduces our lucidity. Prior to applying any technique for leaving the body, you should work with energies for the purpose of making the energy  body  more  flexible  and  facilitating  the  separation  of  the extraphysical body. Working with energies can make us feel colder. </p>
<p><a id="p210"></a>Note:  Be  aware  that  if  your  room  is  air-conditioned,  your  body temperature will start to lower after lying still for some time so you should take this into account when setting the thermostat. </p>
<p><b>Illumination</b></p>


<p class="calibre1" id="top">A  stable  condition  of  semi-darkness  or  darkness  is  best,  as  this  will diminish  external  stimulation  and  help  the  pineal  gland  to  produce the  hormone  melatonin,  which  helps  us  to  relax.  A  deep  state  of relaxation is essential to being able to leave the physical body. </p>
<p><b>Noise Level</b></p>
<p>Any noise from the physical environment will call your attention  to your  physical  surrounds  and  thus  prevent  you  from  being  able  to focus on the extraphysical dimension so the quieter your environment, the better. Complete silence is ideal. Unfortunately, those of us who live in cities are usually subject to some degree of external noise from the traffic, aircraft flying overhead, dogs and neighbors, etc. If this is your case, an air conditioner that produces a continuous white noise can help to block out other, intermittent noises. Soft furnishing like carpets, rugs and curtains can also absorb and reduce noise. </p>
<p><b>Sensorial Stimulation</b></p>
<p>Anything  or  anyone  touching  you  or  making  a  noise  while  you  are trying  to  project  will  disturb  your  attempts.  This  point  especially relates to those of you who share a bed with a partner and/or pets. So what is your situation? If your partner snores, grinds his or her teeth, talks in his or her sleep, is restless, or pulls the duvet off you, you may need  to  do  your  projection  work  in  another  room.  With  regards  to pets,  don’t  have  them  on  your  bed  or  in  your  room  when  you  are trying to project. The ideal is that you be in an environment that has no sensorial stimulation at all so try to get as close to this condition as possible. </p>
<p><b>Clothes</b></p>
<p>Nudity gives us a great sense of liberty and freedom. If you are not comfortable being naked, wear light, loose fitting clothing that doesn’t restrict you in any way such as pajamas or a tracksuit. </p>
<p>Note  however  that  there  is  not  necessarily  a  direct  connection between  what  we  wear  to  bed  and  how  we  are  dressed  outside  the, <a id="p211"></a>body. Our appearance in the extraphysical dimension, including how we are dressed, is a reflection of how we see ourselves. So if you are 80 but the overriding image you have of yourself is as a young man, you  will  look  like  a  young  man  when  you  are  projected.  If  at  the moment we “wake up” outside the body we notice that our nudity or the way that we are dressed is inappropriate for the circumstances in which we find ourselves, e.g. walking down the street in our pajamas, this  can  helpfully  prompt  us  to  realize  that  we  are  projected  rather than dreaming and increase our level of lucidity. We can then dress ourselves any way we want. </p>
<p><b>Furnishings and Beddings</b></p>
<p>Placing pillows under your neck, knees and even arms can promote a deep  sense  of  relaxation.  So  experiment  with  cushions  and  pillows until you find the set-up that allows you to be as comfortable and free of  tension  as  possible.  If  you  have  a  partner,  individual  blankets  or duvets or a bigger bed may help reduce disturbances from him or her. </p>
<p>Duvets and blankets shouldn’t be so heavy, though, that you can feel their weight on you. </p>
<p>Also,  try  to  diminish  the  amount  of  furniture  and  clutter  in  your bedroom. Have only what is necessary. If your room is cluttered with furniture, electrical equipment, art, gifts and other decorative items, from force of habit you will feel restricted in terms of where you can move when you leave the body, even though you are not. </p>
<p><b>Infrastructure</b></p>
<p>You will need a digital clock, a notepad, pencil, calendar and diary by your bed for the purpose of recording your extraphysical experiences when you wake up. The digital clock will allow you to note the time that you lie down to begin your attempt and the time you return from your projection. A calendar is useful in case you wake up not knowing what day it is and are perhaps anxious that you have to get up and go to work on a day that you don’t need to. This could interfere with the recall  of  the  projection.  I  will  explain  the  purpose  and  benefits  of recording  the  details  of  your  projections  and  other  altered  states  of consciousness in<a href="index_split_002_split10.html#p231"> chapter 18. </a></p>
<p><b>Ideal Time</b></p>
<p>The best time to attempt to project is when the physical body is most, <a id="p212"></a>relaxed,  so  there  is  no  ideal  time  as  this  is  an  individual  thing  that varies from person to person. But we already know that darkness and silence facilitate lucid projections. So if we consider that the majority of the population goes to sleep somewhere between 11:00 p.m. and midnight we can calculate that 3:00 a.m. represents the middle of the night  for  most  people,  and  is  therefore  the  time  of  least  noise  and external interference. So this can be an ideal time to try to leave the body. </p>
<p>By  this  time  the  brain  will  also  be  somewhat  rested  from  having had  some  sleep,  which  will  help  you  to  achieve  a  better  level  of lucidity,  but  the  body  will  still  feel  tired  enough  to  relax  and  be tranquil during the application of a projective technique. The pineal gland  also  peaks  its  production  of  melatonin  in  the  middle  of  the night,  which  will  further  aid  your  relaxation.  If  you  want  to  try projecting at 3:00 a.m., set an alarm and then take the time to wake yourself  fully  before  your  attempt,  to  avoid  falling  straight  back  to sleep. </p>
<p><b>Weather</b></p>
<p>No special meteorological conditions are conducive to having an OBE. </p>
<p>If  certain  weather  conditions  affect  or  frighten  you,  delay  your attempt until they have passed. </p>
<p><b>Physical and Physiological Factors</b></p>
<p><b>Experiment with Your Projective Posture</b></p>
<p>The position we assume when attempting a projection can help us to be  more  lucid  outside  the  body  and  to  recall  the  experience  later. </p>
<p>Lying  on  our  back  in  the  dorsal  position  is  best  as  this  is   <i>not</i>  the switch-off position for most people. Mostly when people are ready to go to sleep (i.e. black out, lose their lucidity), they turn and lie on one side  or  partially  on  their  stomach.  So  when  we  assume  the  dorsal position  we  send  a  subtle  message  to  ourselves  that  we  are  not switching  off,  we  are  alert  and  ready  for  anything.  The  idea  is  that you  allow  the  physical  body  to  go  to  sleep  but  that  mentally  you remain alert. This way you will be able to experience the lucid takeoff of the extraphysical body. If you are not accustomed to relaxing in the dorsal position, practice! In time you will get used to it. </p>
<p><b>Avoid Food and Drink</b></p>
<p><a id="p213"></a>There  are  two  things  to  take  into  account  here.  First,  because  your heart rate increases when you are digesting a meal, you will  find  it more difficult to relax when you are preparing to project if you have eaten within two hours of lying down. Second, you should avoid foods that  have  a  high  water  content  such  as  watermelon,  and  especially drinks that are stimulants or diuretics such as coffee and tea. So don’t have anything to eat or drink within two hours of lying down to avoid being disturbed during a projection by an elevated heart rate or the need to go to the bathroom. </p>
<p>Note:  the  rate  at  which  we  produce  urine  often  increases  with energy work. </p>
<p><b>Fulfill Your Physiological Needs</b></p>
<p>Empty  the  bladder  just  prior  to  lying  down.  Constipation  (blocked umbilico-chakra)  can  also  interfere  with  projections,  so  make  sure your diet is balanced. </p>
<p><b>Be Well-Rested and Relaxed</b></p>
<p>It is important to be well-rested when attempting to project to avoid immediately  falling  asleep.  Deep  relaxation  is  also  prerequisite  to being  able  to  forget  all  about  your  physical  body  and  environment and  so  as  to  focus  your  attention  on  the  more  subtle  extraphysical realities. </p>
<p><b>Clean Your Nasal Passage</b></p>
<p>Clean your nasal passage well with water so as nothing interferes with your breathing. </p>
<p><b>Take a Hydromagnetic Shower</b></p>
<p>You may even like to take what’s known as a hydromagnetic shower in  preparation  for  a  projection.  This  involves  sending  energies  out through your crown chakra (at the top of the head) against the flow of the  water  when  you  are  standing  under  the  shower.  The  water  will then  come  back  and  cleanse  your  energy  body,  improving  the condition of your energies a little from their current condition. So if you’re  in  bad  shape  energetically,  this  exercise  will  help  in  some measure but it won’t unblock any energetic blockages, for example. Be sure to watch the water temperature. If the water’s too hot you will become mentally sluggish and if it’s too cold you will be too alert to, <a id="p214"></a>relax.  Also,  for  the  first  few  times  that  you  do  the  hydromagnetic shower,  lean  against  the  shower  wall  and  support  yourself  in  case working  with  energies  makes  you  feel  unsteady  in  any  way.  With repetition, this exercise will help to activate your crown chakra and improve your awareness outside of the body. </p>
<p><b>Control the Monkey Within! </b></p>
<p>Remember that the physical body is just a monkey of sorts with a lot of instincts. If you are going to leave the body you have to learn to control the urge to move (scratch, swallow, blink, shift your weight, etc.) and the urge to sleep. </p>
<p><b>Psychological Factors</b></p>
<p>•    Be  confident  that  you  can  have  a  projection.  With perseverance,  blockages,  fears  and  conditionings  can  be eliminated and everybody can achieve positive results. </p>
<p>•  Have positive intentions that you will have an enlightening, lucid, out-of-body experience, and know that if anything worries you during the OBE, all you have to do is think of your physical body and instantly you will return to the body. </p>
<p>•  Use your will to combat boredom, distraction and impatience for things to happen quickly. How long will you have to apply a technique before you start to leave the body? If in your case it takes around 75 minutes but you always give up on the technique after 20, you won’t achieve results. So use your will to persevere in terms of time spent applying the techniques and in terms of the frequency of your attempts to leave the body. </p>
<p>•  Be stable and calm before attempting to project. Have a quiet frame  of  mind.  If  you  try  to  project  when  you  are  emotional, excited, anxious, fearful or agitated, it will be more difficult for you to leave the body and your emotionality will make it harder for you to stay outside the body. So avoid fighting and arguing, watching  movies  that  are  emotionally  demanding,  listening  to music  that  winds  you  up,  playing  violent  computer  games  that leave  you  agitated,  or  doing  anything  else  that  gives  you  an adrenalin rush before trying to project. </p>
<p>•    Understand  clearly  your  objectives  for  leaving  the  body. </p>
<p>Know where you want to go. Know what you want to do. Write it, <a id="p215"></a>down. Want  it! Be  motivated  by your  goals and  concentrate on achieving them. </p>
<p>•  Be mentally alert. </p>
<p>•  Remember that you are not just the physical body. You are a consciousness  that  is  free  to  travel  across  dimensions.  So  forget all about your physical body and your material surrounds. Focus your  awareness  outwards,  on  the  extraphysical  dimension,  not inwards. </p>
<p>•    Don’t  have  any  preconceived  ideas  or  expectations  of  how things should happen. For example, don’t expect to float up out of the  body  because  maybe  you  will  sink  down  through  the  floor; don’t try to force yourself out through the head because maybe your helpers are trying to pull you out through your feet. So be open. Wait to see what is happening first and then go with that. </p>
<p>•  Above all, be ready to find yourself lucid outside the body. As Vieira wrote in Projectiology:</p>
<p> <i><b>If  you  are  really  interested  in  producing  lucid  consciential projections  or  have  tried  to  provoke  such  experiences,  prepare yourself  psychologically  to  accept  spontaneous  lucid  projections because  they  might  occur  during  any  favorable  opportunity  from now on. (Vieira, 2002)</b></i></p>
<p><b>Bioenergetic Factors Vibrational State</b></p>
<p>Installing  a  vibrational  state  prior  to  projecting  will  keep  you balanced and protected while outside the body and will prevent other projected  or  extraphysical  individuals  from  coupling  energetically with you. </p>
<p><b>Thoughts, Sentiments and Energies</b></p>
<p>Remember from <a href="index_split_000_split12.html#p78">chapter 4</a> how our thoughts, sentiments and energies are intertwined? If we think about projecting with lucidity every day we will charge the energetic field around us with our desire to project and create connections that will facilitate and support our endeavors. </p>
<p>So  have  materials  related  to  lucid  projection  around  your  house—</p>
<p>have books on the subject next to your bed, posters on the wall, watch DVDs about OBEs, visit quality websites regularly, listen to relevant radio interviews on the internet, etc. </p>
<p><a id="p216"></a><b>Extraphysical Conditions</b></p>
<p>Don’t forget to think about what is going on around you nonphysically and to cleanse the energies in your bedroom and house regularly so as the  extraphysical  conditions  are  positive  and  balanced,  and  thus conducive to your efforts to project. </p>
<p><b>Parapsychic Factors</b></p>
<p><b>Parapsychic Perceptions</b></p>
<p>How  well-developed  are  your  parapsychic  perceptions?  Are  your helpers there trying to lift you out of the body but you don’t perceive them  so  you  roll  over  and  go  to  sleep?  Are  your  blind  guides  there trying  to  stop  you  from  leaving  the  body  but  you  don’t  perceive anything  negative  so  you  think  they  are  your  helpers?  We  need  to invest the time to become more parapsychic—and this will develop as a natural consequence of working more proficiently with our energies (Trivellato, 2006). </p>
<p><b>General Comments About Preparation for a Projection</b> Research shows that all the factors described in this chapter facilitate lucid  projection.  At  the  same  time,  we  are  all  individuals  and  all, some or none of these optimizations may prove useful to you. So you have to practice and experiment with different conditions and find out which  combinations  facilitate  your  experiences.  You  will  also  learn which  variables  hinder  your  efforts  so  make  a  mental  note  of  these also and be sure to address them during your preparations. </p>
<p>You  have  to  experiment  with  all  of  the  external,  physical, physiological,  psychological,  bioenergetic,  extraphysical  and parapsychic factors that can affect your projectability and invest the time  to  tweak  and  adjust  the  variables  until  you  come  up  with  a combination  that  yields  results.  Some  key  variables  relate  to  your overall energetic capacity and emotional balance, while more minor variables  relate  to  specific  personal  attributes  that  you  can  control with your will, such as your level of confidence or openness. In the end, the height of the pillow under your neck might be the only thing standing between success and failure. If, however, any of the variables are  completely  off,  you’re  unlikely  to  achieve  a  lucid  projection. </p>
