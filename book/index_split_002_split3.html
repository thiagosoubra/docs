<p>Holomaturity</p>
<p>Consciential  evolution  is  the  journey  of  the  consciousness  from immaturity to maturity. </p>
<p> <i>—Waldo Vieira</i></p>
<p><b>Types of Maturity</b></p>
<p>At its core, the process of evolution is a function of increasing one’s level of maturity. If we are striving to become lucid multidimensional beings, then it is just as important that we know how to behave with maturity outside the body as inside the body. Cosmoethics are morals that help us to do this, as they are applicable everywhere we go, both physically and extraphysically. We will discuss cosmoethics at length in the next chapter. But for now, let’s consider what it means to be mature. </p>
<p>Maturity can be defined as the state or quality of being fully grown or developed. It is when something has reached a level of readiness or perfection,  such  as  when  a  fruit  is  ripe  or  a  plan  is  ready  to  be implemented.  As  human  consciousnesses,  we  have  three  different types of maturity:</p>
<p><b>Physiological Maturity</b></p>
<p>Physiological or biological maturity is when the body is fully grown; this is usually reached at around the age of 26. It may appear that the body  has  stopped  growing  earlier  but  our  long  bones  are  still producing new cells up until the age of 26. The exact age at which we reach physiological maturity varies from person to person and there are also some differences between men and women, as girls tend to mature  biologically  more  quickly  than  boys.  It  is  also  commonly believed that women age more quickly than men but as yet there is no evidence to support this. At any rate, we can say that by the age of 26, the body has reached its full potential. </p>
<p><a id="p181"></a><b>Psychological Maturity</b></p>
<p>On  average,  we  reach  psychological  maturity  at  the  age  of  35.  Up until  this  time  we  are  acquiring  psychological  maturity  through learning about ourselves and how to deal with all the different types of  people  we  come  into  contact  with  in  society.  It  is  when  we  are adept  at  managing  the  various  relationships  in  our  lives,  those  we have with our family, relatives, partners, bosses, colleagues, friends, neighbors,  teachers,  students  and  pets,  that  we  have  psychological maturity.  We  know  how  to  stand  up  for  ourselves  and  deal  with confrontation  calmly;  we  are  flexible  and  able  to  make  concessions within reason; we have learned how to properly consider the needs of others;  we’re  not  too  demanding  and  selfish;  we  are  able  to  take responsibility for others, etc. </p>
<p>Psychological maturity can be recognized in people who are stable, and balanced in their opinions and emotions. We see that teenagers haven’t yet acquired this type of maturity because they are impulsive and highly charged emotionally. They tend to create mountains out of mole hills, dramatizing little problems into big issues. </p>
<p>While it is possible to acquire psychological maturity by the age of 35,  obviously  it’s  more  difficult  to  measure  than  physiological maturity.  The  nature  of  some  cultures  can  also  either  facilitate  or hinder its development. There are indigenous people living in remote rain  forests  in  Brazil,  for  example,  who  don’t  really  experience adolescence.  As  soon  as  the  boys  reach  sexual  maturity  they  are considered to be adults, meaning their carefree days of childhood are over by the age of 13 or 14 and they have to assume all the discipline and  responsibilities  of  manhood.  In  circumstances  like  these, individuals can reach psychological maturity very early. </p>
<p><b>Intellectual Maturity</b></p>
<p>Several  criteria  need  to  be  met  in  order  to  acquire  intellectual maturity,  which  is  generally  reached  around  the  age  of  50.  They include the following:</p>
<p>•    We  need  some  life  experience  to  be  able  to  accomplish something  intellectually.  Very  rarely  do  we  see  children  or teenagers proposing new laws in physics, or writing new theories in  psychology,  economics  or  mathematics,  for  example. </p>
<p>Renowned  intellectuals  such  Einstein  and  Jung  were  not  young, <a id="p182"></a>when  they  wrote  their  masters’  theses.  One  of  the  most intellectually  challenging  roles  in  the  world  is  to  be  the democratically elected leader of a country so, in principle, a high level  of  intelligence  would  be  a  prerequisite  for  the  task. </p>
<p>Accordingly, the majority of the presidents of the United States were between 50- and 59- years old when elected to office. </p>
<p>•    Another  criterion  for  intellectual  maturity  is  the  ability  to analyze and criticize knowledge, an ability that not everyone has. </p>
<p>Some people believe everything that they read about dieting, for example, even ideas or principles that contradict one another. I have  also  met  many  people  who  have  extensively  studied  one particular  subject  related  to  multidimensionality,  such  as  past lives, and believe everything they’ve ever read on the subject, to the  point  of  defending  opposing  theories.  This  shows  that  they lack the ability to discern that one line of thought is better than another  because  of  x,  y  and  z.  So  intellectual  maturity  is  also about knowing how to differentiate things that appear to be close to one another. </p>
<p>•    The  opposite  of  this  strong  trait  is  what  is  known  as Manichaeism.  Manichaeism  is  when  we  see  things  as  black  or white,  right  or  wrong.  To  give  an  example,  according  to  the religion in which I was raised, abortion is always wrong. But real life is not quite so simplistic. What if a female patient in a coma is  raped  by  a  staff  member  while  she’s  in  the  hospital  and becomes  pregnant?  What  if  a  12-year-old  girl  is  raped  and becomes pregnant by her father? What if a woman has multiple fetuses growing in her womb, but due to overcrowding the lives of  all  of  them  are  at  risk?  Would  abortion  be  wrong  in  these cases? So intellectual maturity also requires that our discernment be  well  developed;  that  we  have  the  ability  to  see  the  bigger picture,  which  includes  the  many  shades  of  grey  between  the black and white. The more shades we can see, the better. </p>
<p>•  Someone with intellectual maturity can also associate ideas, meaning they can combine their logic, rationality and intelligence to  make  new  connections  or  associations  between  (apparently) unrelated  disciplines.  Quantum  physics,  which  connects traditional  physics  to  philosophy,  is  a  good  example  of  an association of ideas. This ability shows that a person’s thinking is, <a id="p183"></a>rich  and  has  depth.  But,  again,  we  can’t  expect  it  from  people who are too young. </p>
<p>•    The  intellect  of  a  person  with  intellectual  maturity  is multifaceted,  meaning  he  has  acquired  different  types  of intelligence;  e.g.  linguistic,  musical,  spatial,  psychic, evolutionary, mathematical, etc. </p>
<p>•    We  can  all  be  consumers  of  intellectuality  such  as  we  are when we pursue an academic course or read a book. But when a person  can  produce  something  intellectual,  such  as  a  research scientist,  inventor,  composer  or  writer  (and  in  certain  cases,  an artist)  does,  this  is  an  indication  (rather  than  a  criteria)  of achievement of intellectual maturity. </p>
<p><b>Holomaturity</b></p>
<p>In  each  life  that  we’ve  had  we  will  have  acquired  some  level  of physiological and psychological maturity. Some people, in some lives, will  also  have  acquired  varying  levels  of  intellectual  and  energetic maturity. Now think of the cumulative value of these maturities over many lives, for this accumulation builds up inside the consciousness. </p>
<p>In addition to this, we also gain experience and wisdom, and therefore maturity,  in  between  lives.  Maybe  some  of  us  dedicated  our intermissive  periods  to  helping  others,  visiting  other  planets  and learning about extraterrestrial extraphysical communities, or to taking advanced intermissive study courses, etc. It is this accumulation of the overall maturity of the consciousness that is known as holomaturity. </p>
<p> <i><b>Holomaturity is best defined as the maturity of the consciousness based  on  the  consciential  paradigm,  which  acknowledges  that  the true nature of the consciousness extends far beyond the boundaries of the physical realm. </b></i></p>
<p><b>Recognizing Mature Consiousnesses</b></p>
<p>If we are projected outside the body or in between lives, how will we recognize the extraphysical consciousnesses who are more mature? As we can change the way we look in the extraphysical dimension, the appearance of an extraphysical consciousness is a very poor indicator of his level of maturity. A mature consciousness can look like a baby. </p>
<p>An immature consciousness can look like an old man. So appearance tells us nothing. </p>
<p><a id="p184"></a>A lot of information about a person is carried in his energies and, of course, we can feel the energies of others outside the body. So when you perceive that a person is detached, wiser, more serene and lucid, settled within himself and has a good level of cosmoethics, you will easily recognize that this is a mature, evolved consciousness. </p>
<p>An extraphysical consciousness who is not mature has none of these traits and this will also be apparent in his energies. In the case of the post-mortem  parapsychotics  for  example,  you  will  sense  that  they have  a  very  low  level  of  maturity  and  self-awareness,  that  they  are lost, confused and distressed. </p>
<p>Even  in  the  physical  dimension,  appearances  aren’t  a  reliable indication of  the maturity  of a  consciousness.  It’s not  uncommon  to encounter  a  woman  in  her  forties  with  the  emotional  maturity  of  a teenager, or a fully grown man with the egocentric perspective of a child.  On  the  other  hand,  sometimes  we  see  young  people  and children  who  show  excellent  wisdom  and  balance,  giving  advice, counselling, perhaps even comforting their parents. So this is a mature consciousness inside a physically immature body. </p>
<p><b>Examples of Maturities and Immaturities of the Consciousness</b></p>
<p>Now that we understand in broad terms what holomaturity is, let’s get down to the actual detail of what it means to behave with a level of holomaturity in daily life. The most important thing to understand is that  the  standard  or  usual  behavior  of  a  mature  consciousness  will always be cosmoethical. Here are several examples of such behaviors, each  one  listed  with  the  corresponding  immaturity  that  manifests when the maturity is not present. </p>
<p><b>Rationality / Emotionality</b></p>
<p><b>Rationality</b></p>
<p>When we have rationality, our thinking is driven by our mental body so we think with clarity and make decisions based on pondering all the  variables  in  a  situation.  We  also  have  control  of,  or  less dependency on, emotions. The more mature we are the less interested we are in emotions and emotionality. But this is not repression. Nor is it to say that we are without feelings. We have feelings, but we’re not unbalanced by them. </p>
<p><a id="p185"></a><b>Emotionality</b></p>
<p>By  contrast,  when  we  are  emotional  we  make  decisions  based  on impulse  and  volatility,  and  our  thinking  is  not  sophisticated  or complex. This is immaturity. </p>
<p><b>Science / Mysticism</b></p>
<p><b>Science</b></p>
<p>Adopting a scientific approach to life means you analyze everything according to the evidence and the facts. You accept nothing less. </p>
<p><b>Mysticism</b></p>
<p>A mystical approach to life, on the other hand, means that you accept things  that  are  a  mystery.  According  to  the  dictionary,  a  mystery  is anything  that  remains  unexplained  or  unknown  or  is  not  fully understood.  To  accept  anything  that  has  no  verifiable  basis  is immature. </p>
<p><b>Assistance to Others / Egocentrism</b></p>
<p><b>Assistance to Others</b></p>
<p> <i><b>Assistance is part of a normal, mature life. We help others when we give  them  our  energy,  our  time;  when  we  share  our  knowledge,  experience  and  ideas;  when  we  clarify  them,  listen  to  them  and support  them.  Sometimes  the  best  way  to  help  is  to  give  money  if money is what’s needed. Other times, the smallest gesture will have the greatest effect. </b></i></p>
<p>The person with a propensity for assisting others is someone who came to physical life to serve others and is conscious of doing so in his everyday life. This person has discovered what it is to be useful. </p>
<p><b>Egocentrism</b></p>
<p>Egocentrism is a complex concept, as it starts with something that’s not exactly negative. As children grow up they believe themselves to be  the  center  of  the  universe.  This  is  a  normal  part  of  human development and in normal circumstances it leads to the development of  healthy  self-esteem  and  other  positive  traits.  Later  on  however, during  adolescence,  we  discover  that  the  world  doesn’t  revolve around us. When people don’t adjust to this realization and continue, <a id="p186"></a>to  be  egocentric  into  adulthood,  egocentrism  becomes  negative,  for this is just selfishness. Selfish people don’t want to help others, don’t make a  proper contribution  in  life and  allow others  to  shoulder  the burden of their responsibilities. </p>
<p>In truth, many people are selfish to some extent. Even those who know they should assist others and make an effort to do so, do it in a self-serving  way,  helping  only  the  people  who  are  close  to  them, usually their first and second families. </p>
<p><b>Universalism / Sectarianism</b></p>
<p><b>Universalism</b></p>
<p>Universalism is all about inclusion—it is when you consider all people and identify and integrate yourself within the community, the state, the  nation,  the  continent,  the  planet  and  the  universe.  Universalism therefore  is  the  practice  of  not  segregating  anybody.  Some  good examples  of  universalism  are:  the  defense  of  human  rights;  the principles of pacifism and nonviolence; disarmament; the preservation of  nature;  the  global  minimization  of  pollution;  and  international campaigns to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, to fight child labor and to eradicate poverty. A universalistic viewpoint will lead us to  become  less  private,  less  selfish  or  egotistical,  and  better  able  to coexist with others. </p>
<p>A  good  friend  of  mine  lived  in  six  countries  across  Europe,  the Middle  East  and  Africa  when  he  was  growing  up  and  told  me  how surprised  he  was  when  he  came  to  London  to  start  his  secondary schooling at the age of 12, to meet boys his own age who had never been outside the UK and so held that there was only one way of doing things—that being the British way. So a lack of exposure to different points of view is not ideal for developing this trait. </p>
<p><b>Sectarianism</b></p>
<p>Sectarianism  or  bigotry,  the  corresponding  immaturity,  is  the  act  of separating  or  discriminating  against  others.  Some  examples  of sectarianism  are  racism,  chauvinism,  sexism,  ageism,  patriotism  and classism.  Classism  is  very  much  in  evidence  in  the  UK  with  the monarchy at the top of the hierarchy followed by the aristocracy, then the  upper  class,  middle  class  and  lower  classes.  It  is  also  alive  and well in India where people discriminate against one other on the basis, <a id="p187"></a>of caste. Teenagers are among the worst segregators of all—separating off into little cliques and groups that exclude others, and bullying kids who don’t fit the mold. </p>
<p>So what about us—how often does our universalism fail? In what situations  do  we  still  separate  people?  How  do  we  exclude  others? </p>
<p>Give it some thought. This will help you to achieve a better level of holomaturity. If others outside of the group of people we choose to be with need us, we have to be ready to help. Outside the body we see very primitive extraphysical people, and others who are not balanced, who  are  ugly  or  deformed.  Can  we  give  assistance  to  these consciousnesses, clarify them or heal them with our energies? </p>
<p><b>Determination / Accommodation</b></p>
<p><b>Determination</b></p>
<p>Are  we  determined  to  evolve  as  consciousnesses  and  deal  with  the pressure  of  swimming  against  the  tide?  Are  we  ready  to  “unlearn" some things we know and create some new thought processes? Are we prepared to step out of our comfort zone, prioritize things that don’t bring us status or respect, give up some things that we like, and make some sacrifices? </p>
<p><b>Accommodation</b></p>
<p>Or  are  we  accommodated  in  our  lives,  living  a  safe,  predictable existence  that  doesn’t  present  any  challenges  or  risks?  Are  we unwilling to do anything new? Are we just repeating our last life? </p>
<p><b>Clarification / Consolation</b></p>
<p><b>Clarification</b></p>
<p> <i><b>If you give a person a fish, you feed him for one day. If you teach a person  to  fish,  you  feed  him  for  the  rest  of  his  life.  This  is clarification.  Clarification  is  when  you  help  someone  to  help themselves, so it is a more advanced level of assistance. </b></i></p>
<p>It’s  when  you  give  advice  in  order  to  deal  with  the   <i>cause</i>  of  a problem. Sometimes the effects of clarification last forever, such as if you if teach or empower a person to recycle and heal his own life. It’s from your mental body to the mental body of the other person. But be aware that clarification involves saying “no” more often. What if your, <a id="p188"></a>sister is being abused by her husband, who is violent towards her and then  apologetic  by  turns,  and  who  has  manipulated  her  into "understanding”  and  accepting  his  behavior?  What  does  she  need from  you—your  agreement  that  her  husband  is  justified  in  hitting her?  No.  Clarification  is  to  say  “No,  this  is  wrong;  this  is  not acceptable  behavior  under  any  circumstances,”  even  if  it’s  not  what your  sister  wants  to  hear.  So  do  you  provide  some  clarification  for other people once in a while? Or do you offer only consolation? Or do you not give any assistance at all? </p>
<p><b>Consolation</b></p>
<p>To  provide  consolation  is  to  sympathize,  comfort,  listen,  provide support,  and  offer  a  shoulder  to  cry  on.  It’s  when  you  use  your emotions  to  alleviate  the  emotions  of  another.  But  with  consolation you  treat  the  symptoms  not  the  disease,  so  it  is  an  emergency procedure, a short-term solution, a superficial cure only. That said, it’s better to give consolation than no assistance at all. </p>
<p>When  you  become  proficient  at  working  with  your  energies, sometimes people  will ask  you to  perform  energetic healing.  This  is consolation. And when people are weak or ill, this is the right thing to do.  Imagine  a  woman  loses  a  child.  She  will  be  fragile  and  grief-stricken,  so  the  best  thing  you  can  do  it  to  provide  consolation, including energetic healing to calm her during the crisis. It is certainly not  the  time  to  give  a  strong  lecture.  But  we  don’t  want  anyone  to become dependent on us, so once the crisis has passed and the person is strong again, we should clarify them. In a situation like the example given here, this might mean explaining that no one ever really dies; that the child has returned to the extraphysical hometown where his extraphysical  family  will  provide  support;  and  that  the  karmic connection  between  a  mother  and  child  is  the  strongest  there  is, meaning that your friend and her child will share future lives together</p>
<p>—they will be together again. </p>
<p><b>Polykarma / Egokarma</b></p>
<p><b>Polykarma</b></p>
<p>We  have  already  discussed  karma  but  it  is  worth  emphasizing  here that polykarma—when the consequences of your actions reach large numbers  of  people  that  you  don’t  know—is  an  act  of  a  mature, <a id="p189"></a>consciousness. </p>
<p><b>Egokarma</b></p>
<p>Egokarma is a trait of a less mature consciousness, when your actions have consequences only for you. </p>
<p><b>Main Brain / Sub-Brain</b></p>
<p><b>Main Brain</b></p>
<p>Our  main  brain,  the  encephalic  or  cerebral  brain,  is  located  in  the head. This brain guides the behavior of a person who is more mature. </p>
<p><b>Sub-Brain</b></p>
<p>The sub-brain, abdominal brain or belly brain is a center of bioenergy located  in  our  abdomen  that  relates  to  the  lower  three  chakras;  the umbilical-chakra,  the  spleen-chakra  and  the  sex-chakra.  Human beings  have  more  neurons  in  their  bellies  that  control  digestion, release  hormones  and  perform  other  functions  than  some  animals have  in  their  main  brain.  Our  intestines,  for  example,  produce  80 percent  of  the  serotonin  in  our  bodies.  So  the  sub-brain  plays  an important role in our physiology and, as it runs on automatic pilot, we don’t have to consciously manage many of the body’s functions, which is wonderful. </p>
<p>But  if  a  person  is  ruled  by  this  brain,  his  behavior  bypasses  the logic, rationality and discernment of his mental faculties and is driven instead by his instincts, desires and physiological needs. For example, he may eat or drink too much or be controlled by his sexual impulses. </p>
<p>Sex is a good thing but maybe we dedicate only 5 percent of our time and 10 percent of our thoughts to it, so if a person is thinking about sex  100  percent  of  the  time  there  is  something  wrong.  This  sort  of obsession can lead to sexual crime. Territorialism  is  also  belly-brain behavior. A dimension of gang warfare, for example, arises from the instinctual defense of territories. </p>
<p><b>Energetic Control / Uunconscious Intrusion</b></p>
<p><b>Energetic Control</b></p>
<p>The capacity to install the vibrational state and to exteriorize energy at  will,  anywhere,  anytime,  in  any  condition,  and  thus  be  free  of, <a id="p190"></a>intrusion, is a trait of a mature consciousness. A person does not start to gain any significant amount of control over his bioenergies before passing through the first death. Once this has occurred it usually takes several lives to reach a good level of energetic control and maturity. </p>
<p>There is also a stronger correlation between bioenergetic maturity and holomaturity  than  with  holomaturity  and  the  other  maturities mentioned earlier in this chapter. </p>
<p><b>Unconscious Intrusion</b></p>
<p>Or do we have no energetic control at all? Are we intruded and not even aware of it? </p>
<p><b>Will / Psychological Crutches</b></p>
<p><b>Will</b></p>
<p>Our will is a powerful attribute of the mental body. Using our will, we can  learn  to  defend  ourselves  energetically,  clear  ourselves  of energetic  blockages,  develop  our  psychism,  leave  the  body  with lucidity,  understand  our  purpose  in  life  and  overcome  some weaknesses and limitations. When our behavior is driven by our will, we are the masters of our own reality, meaning we don’t need to be led by someone else. A strong will is an attribute of a mature person and a quality often seen in leaders. </p>
<p><b>Psychological Crutches</b></p>
<p>Psychological  crutches,  on  the  other  hand,  are  external  objects  that we lean on, that we use to protect ourselves or to prop ourselves up when we believe that we are not capable of standing on our own two feet. </p>
<p>A  lot  of  insecure  people  become  dependent  on  all  sorts  of psychological crutches that they use for a variety of purposes, such as to increase their psychic capacities, to improve their health, to acquire wealth and power, to feel more confident, to seduce the opposite sex and  for  protection.  Some  examples  of  pyschological  crutches  are: drugs, prescription medications, alcohol, tarot cards, ouija boards (for evocating or summoning extraphysical consciousnesses), crystal balls, charms,  horseshoes,  talismans  and  objects  of  superstition  such  as rabbits’ feet. </p>
<p>Having  lived  in  several  countries,  I  have  witnessed  people  of  a, <a id="p191"></a>variety  of  cultures  and  religions  using  their  God  or  god/gods  and goddesses as a crutch. Did you get hit by a bus and lose both of your legs?  Thanks  to  (insert  name  of  favorite  god)!  If  not  for  him  you would have died! Never mind that you couldn’t be bothered to walk 100  meters  to  the  pedestrian  overpass  and  instead  tried  to  cross  a busy six-lane highway on foot. This sort of behavior is typical of many religions  whose  adherents  believe  that  it  is  their  God  or  god  who decides their fate and that they don’t have any control over their lives. </p>
<p>It  is  a  way  of  absolving  themselves  of  responsibility  for  their  own reality. </p>
<p>It has to be said that many psychological crutches do in fact make us feel good. Usually this is because people who use them  <i>believe</i> that they have certain powers, so the effect is the same as when subjects taking part in medical trials respond positively to placebos thinking they are taking actual medication. But think for a minute. If we are multidimensional, multiserial beings who can read what is going on around us physically and extraphysically through the mastery of our energies;  who  can  effectively  defend  ourselves  against  any  type  of intrusion; who can heal and unblock ourselves and who can dynamize our  own  evolution  through  the  application  of  the  attributes  of  our mental  body,  then  do  we  really  believe  that  a  rabbit’s  foot  is  more powerful than we are? Certainly it didn’t help the rabbit. </p>
<p>Even the projective techniques that we use to leave the body are a kind of crutch. We don’t want to become dependent on them; ideally we will be able to leave the body through the application of our will rather than via a bunch of technical procedures. </p>
<p>We don’t want to be dependent on or slaves to anything or anyone. </p>
<p>If we are leaning on psychological crutches of any sort, remember that we can’t take them with us when we die. They’re useless to us when we’re  between  lives.  So  it’s  better  that  we  dispense  with  them  now and get used to the idea that we are the masters of our own reality. </p>
<p> <i><b>Standard Conduct / Exception Conduct</b></i></p>
<p><b>Standard Conduct</b></p>
<p>Standard conduct is what we do most of the time. If we are striving to attain  a  better  level  of  holomaturity  and  to  evolve,  all  the  mature traits listed in this chapter should become our standard conduct, our normal behavior. </p>
<p><a id="p192"></a><b>Exception Conduct</b></p>
<p>Exception conduct is what we do exceptionally and/or when there is no  other  way.  To  give  an  example,  if  a  teenager  experiments  with drugs at school one day as an exception, just to try, then no problem. </p>
<p>But  if  the  experiment  leads  to  addiction  and  becomes  standard conduct, then there is a problem. The exception conduct has become the standard conduct. Another example—healing people with energies should  be  exception  conduct.  The  standard  conduct  for  all  the conscientiological organizations is to teach people to heal themselves. </p>
<p>So  what  about  your  life?  What  behaviors  of  yours  are  exception conduct that should become standard conduct? Do you give assistance to  others  as  an  exception  only?  And  vice  versa.  What  standard conduct do you have that should become exception conduct? </p>
<p> <i><b>Lucid Personal Prioritization / Slave of Social Commitments</b></i> <b>Lucid Personal Prioritization</b> Do we prioritize our evolution? Do we give up doing some things that we enjoy in order to make time for our evolution? </p>
<p><b>Slave of Social Commitments</b></p>
<p>Or  do  we  prioritize  social  commitments  instead,  such  as  birthday parties,  engagement  parties,  office  parties,  dinner  parties,  baptisms, weddings, anniversaries, family dinners, balls, nights out with friends, etc. Of course there’s nothing wrong with any of these things. But we all lead full lives, so if we are serious about improving ourselves, then we need to  <i>make</i> time to practise our energy techniques and projective techniques, keep a diary of our dreams and projections, develop our mental  attributes,  read  books,  identify  our  strong  and  weak  traits, discover our purpose in life, etc. If we are going to invest time in our evolution, we have to give it the priority it deserves. </p>
<p>If you don’t think you have to give anything up for your evolution, that  you  have  time  to  do  everything  you  want  to  do,  it  might  be useful for you to analyze your daily utilization of time and calculate how many hours you actually have at your disposal each day to invest in your development. </p>
<p><b>Daily Utilization of Time</b></p>
<p><a id="p193"></a>The  chart  opposite,  which  is  used  in  the  IAC’s  Consciousness Development Program, is designed to help you understand  how  and where  you  spend  your  time.  Fill  in  the  middle  column  with  the number  of  hours  you  spend  on  average  each  day  doing  the  activity listed in the left column. In the right column, add up the total number of hours to arrive at a final figure of hours accounted for each day in the  bottom  right  hand  corner.  I  have  started  the  calculations  with examples for the first two activities. </p>
<p>Is your total somewhere near 24 hours? When we do this exercise in class at the IAC we find that for most people it is. So if we want to evolve, many of us will have to rearrange our lives in order to find the time  to  do  it.  And  there  are  several  ways  we  can  do  this.  We  can multitask  more—perhaps  you  can  read  while  you  are  travelling  to work, learn a new language by listening to a CD in the car, or catch up on your phone calls from your mobile while walking the dog. Or, you can think of ways to save yourself time. One thing that works for me is to order my grocery shopping online and have it delivered to the house. This service is now available in many big cities around the world and is usually free for a minimum order. This alone can save 2–</p>
<p>3 hours a week. And then there’s just plain old sacrifice peppered with a  healthy  dollop  of  common  sense.  In  the  grander  scheme  of  our multidimensional,  serial  existence,  how  important  is  watching  our favourite soap-opera every night? </p>
<p>Be aware, however, that if you are going to reprioritize your life in favor  of  your  evolution,  you  should  do  it  with  maturity,  balance, wisdom  and  without  any  drastic  attitudes.  Do  you  have  a  family  to take  care  of,  an  elderly  relative  who  is  dependent  on  you,  other karmic  issues  that  require  your  attention,  responsibilities  in  your community outside of the scope of your work, etc.,— <i>and</i> you want to evolve? Then all these commitments and priorities must be executed in  parallel,  cosmoethically,  and  with  discernment.  Evolution  is  no excuse for not fulfilling your responsibilities. </p>

<p><b>Personal prioritization chart</b></p>
<p>As we focus more on our evolution, we find that we do more, we are  busier,  we  use  our  time  more  productively  and  efficiently,  we have less time for doing nothing and little time to waste. </p>
