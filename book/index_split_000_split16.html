<p>The Mechanisms by Which Past-Life Experiences</p>
<p>Affect Our Present Lives</p>
<p>Today  we  are  the  living  summary  of  our  past,  the  result  of  the addition of genetic and environmental characteristics, as well as the expression of everything that we have already lived, thought, felt and done. </p>
<p> <i>—Wagner Alegretti</i></p>
<p><b>Holomemory</b></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, according to leading theories in psychology, we are  all  the  product  of  our  environment  (upbringing)  and  genetic inheritance. Yet each of the categories of clues to past lives explored in the previous chapter presents examples that cannot be adequately explained by this theory. </p>
<p>According  to  conscientiology,  we  are  all  the  product  of  our environment,  our  genetics  and  one  vital  additional  component—our past,  which  includes  both  our  past  physical  lives  and  intermissive periods.  During  our  intermissive  periods,  some  people  receive training, education and even undergo specific procedures to alter the extraphysical body. I mention this because our tendency is usually to think  only  of  our  past  physical  lives  when  we  think  of  our  past, forgetting  that  we  also  accumulate  experiences,  knowledge  and wisdom during the period between lives. </p>
<p>The  mechanisms  by  which  the  memories  and  experiences  of  our past  can  emerge  in  our  present  are  our  holomemory  and  our paragenetics.  Together,  these  act  as  the  matrix  or  template  of  the personality  and  the  physical  body  of  the  consciousness.  Let  me explain. </p>
<p>Although we temporarily forget much of what happens throughout our  lives,  every  experience  we  ever  had  in  every  physical  life  and intermissive  period,  every  incident,  event,  occurrence,  meeting  and <a id="p127"></a>exchange, no matter how minor or insignificant, is registered in the integral  or  holomemory  of  the  consciousness  that  is  stored  in  the mental  body.  Because  we  are  the  sum  of  our  experiences,  the holomemory  then,  is  the  original  source  of  the  personality  of  the consciousness, largely determining the way in which we think, behave and  interact  with  others,  and  allowing  many  habits,  attitudes, attributes,  pathologies,  tendencies,  predilections,  skills,  knowledge, capacities,  affinities,  values  and  principles  that  have  formed  over lifetimes of experiences to emerge in and impact on our present. </p>
<p>You can access your holomemory and any detail from your past by having  a  projection  in  the  mental  body  (a  technique  for  producing such  a  projection  is  described  in  <a href="index_split_002_split8.html#p217">chapter  16</a>).  If  you  succeed  in producing such a projection, you will see that the memories stored by your current physical brain pertaining only to your current physical life,  represent  a  very  small  percentage  indeed  of  your  complete memory. </p>
<p>Holomemory also offers a plausible explanation for some unsolved cases of xenoglossy, child prodigies, exceptional talents, geniuses and the savant syndrome, such as those described in the previous chapter. </p>
<p>A hypothetical explanation of how it works in tandem with other determining factors could be as follows: In the case of some instances of the quite rare savant syndrome, it could be that the consciousness in question has been a genius in many past consecutive lives and that the  specific  skill  of  the  person  is  so  highly  developed  now  that  the consciousness, through his holomemory, “remembers” and manifests the skill in the current life … but that his helpers, perhaps even with the  agreement  of  the  individual  in  the  period  between  lives,  decide that in order to overcome a particular limitation, the person must be born handicapped in this life. Or perhaps his handicap is planned to help him to learn new skills that he will require in future lives as part of  his  evolution  as  a  consciousness.  It  is  also  possible  that  the limitation was caused by a karmic factor. </p>
<p><b>Paragenetics</b></p>
<p>The other means by which our past can manifest in our present is via our  paragenetics.  Paragenetics  are  a  kind  of  genetic  coding  that, unlike  genetics,  are  not  passed  from  one  physical  human  being  to another, but are transmitted from our extraphysical and mental bodies <a id="p128"></a>to our new physical body when we’re reborn. So we pass this coding to ourselves from one life to the next. Working together with genetics, paragenetics  help  to  shape  the  physical  body  and  can  thus  be responsible for some aspects of our physical appearance. </p>
<p>Although  these  two  mechanisms  have  not  been  clearly  elucidated before,  they  have  been  acknowledged.  The  Greek  philosopher  Plato (c.428–347 BC), for example, once stated, “Knowledge easily acquired is that which the enduring soul had in an earlier life, so that it flows back  easily.”  Renowned  twentieth  century  clairvoyant  and  healer Edgar Cayce reached the same conclusion, explaining that “You have inherited most from yourself, not from your family. The family is only a river through which the soul flows.” (Kelly, 1997) The degree to which a person is influenced by his holomemory and paragenetics  varies  depending  on  the  depth  of  maturity  and  the evolutionary level of the consciousness. </p>
<p>An average human being who strongly identifies with physical life and has no real awareness of his broader existence tends to be more influenced and restricted by the conditionings imposed by his genetics and  environment.  His  behavior  is  driven  more  by  the  instinctive processes  of  survival  and  he  is  more  likely  to  repeat  experiences  of past  lives  that  do  not  contribute  in  any  way  to  his  evolution  as  a consciousness.  For  example,  perhaps  a  person’s  life  consists  of  a routine  of  working  on  a  production  line  in  a  manufacturing  plant, spending time at the pub every night after work, going to a football game on Saturday and eating lunch with the family on Sunday after church—a  repetition  of  a  lifestyle  carried  over  from  previous existences.  For  such  a  person,  the  influence  of  his  holomemory  and paragenetics  would  be  minimal,  meaning  he  manifests  less  of  the original source of his personality—less of who he really is. </p>
<p>An  individual  of  a  more  advanced  evolutionary  level  tends  to manifest more traits derived from his holomemory and paragenetics. </p>
<p>This  allows  him  to  overcome  many  of  the  limitations  of  his environment and genetics, as happened in the case of Handel, as well as  benefit  from  the  more  positive  aspects  afforded  by  these  two factors. Such a person usually manifests a greater level of awareness of  multidimensional  realities,  is  more  discerning  and  cosmoethical and  performs  better  in  evolutionary  terms  due  to  multiexistential "baggage” of a higher quality. As the influence of his holomemory and <a id="p129"></a>paragenetics  exceeds  that  of  his  environment  and  genetics,  he manifests more of who he really is. </p>
<p>Bear  in  mind  however,  that  manifesting  more  traits  derived  from one’s  holomemory  and  paragenetics  is  not  always  an  optimizing factor,  as  in  the  cases  of  phobias,  birthmarks  and  birth  defects  for example.  So  sometimes  the  prevalence  of  genetics  over  the paragenetics can be a good thing. </p>
<p> <i><b>If  you  are  motivated  to  be  more  of  who  you  really  are,  more advanced  levels  of  evolution  and  maturity  can  be  achieved  with effort via the lucid, conscious prioritization of self-improvement over numerous lifetimes. </b></i></p>
<p><b>Pathologies of the Mental Body</b></p>
<p>With  regards  to  birthmarks,  birth  defects  and  phobias,  much  of  the scientific  research  referred  to  in  the  last  chapter  suggests  that profound experiences such as traumas can be imprinted on the mental and  extraphysical  bodies  so  strongly  that  they  influence  the paragenetics of the consciousness, which in turn, affect the genetics of the next physical body. </p>
<p>Let’s  take  the  example  of  one  of  the  Burmese  subjects  born  with deformed  and  missing  fingers,  who  recalled  having  his  fingers chopped  off  in  his  previous  life,  prior  to  being  executed.  We  can hypothesize  that  the  trauma  of  the  torture  was  so  severe  that  when this man died and began an existence in the extraphysical dimension, his  extraphysical  body  (the  emotional  body)  was  also  in  a  kind  of shock.  The  impact  was  so  great  in  fact  that  the  extraphysical  body manifested  without  the  fingers  that  had  been  severed  during  the man’s  torture.  In  other  words,  the  image  this  consciousness  had  of itself, even in the extraphysical body, was of missing several fingers. </p>
<p>In this particular instance, this image was so strong that eventually, during  this  person’s  intermissive  period,  the  mental  body  began  to accept  that  this  was  the  real  condition  of  the  consciousness  and formed a fixed idea about it, a pathology, which caused the deformity to  manifest  more  strongly  in  the  extraphysical  body  and  in  turn,  to reappear in the next physical body. So a pathology of the mental body is another mechanism that allows some aspects of our past to emerge in our current life. </p>
<p><a id="p130"></a>It  has  to  be  said  that  such  extremes  are  rare.  A  pathology  of  the mental body caused by a past-life trauma is more likely to manifest as a birthmark, phobia, aversion, or not at all, than as an actual physical deformity.  Many  types  of  phobias  and  aversions  persist  throughout the  multiexistential  cycle  of  a  consciousness  through  this  process, which is why it is important that we make an effort to overcome our limitations. </p>
<p>Another way in which a pathology of the mental body can manifest in  a  person’s  current  existence  is  through  odd  synchronicities.  For example, let’s say a farmer is tilling a hilly field in his tractor, it rolls, he is trapped underneath it and his leg is severed in the accident. He dies a traumatic death from the loss  of  blood.  This  experience  is  so devastating  emotionally  that  after  death  the  extraphysical  body manifests  without  the  leg  and  in  time  the  mental  body  imprints  an image of its physical incarnation as being without a leg. In a future life,  the  farmer  will  have  a  new  body  with  two  legs  and  he  will reestablish an image of himself as a person with two legs. But because the  mental  body  still  carries  this  pathology  and  the  image  of  not having  a  leg  is  still  strong,  synchronicities  can  start  to  happen. </p>
<p>Perhaps he will break the same leg several times throughout his life for  example.  Such  apparent  coincidences  aren’t  always  what  they seem. </p>
<p><b>A Case in Point</b></p>
<p>To  conclude  this  chapter  I  would  like  to  share  the  details  of  a particularly remarkable case investigated by Stevenson in which the subject’s past life produced not one but several of the consequences and repercussions discussed in the last chapter in her current life. </p>
<p>Ma Win Tar, a Burmese girl who remembered her previous life as a Japanese  soldier,  was  born  with  major  defects  of  both  hands,  with fingers missing on both, and with unusual grooves on her fingers and left wrist. </p>
<p>Although the details that Ma Win Tar gave of her last life were not verified,  they  were  historically  plausible.  She  recalled  that  her previous  personality  had  been  captured,  tied  to  a  tree  and  burned alive at the hands of a group of Burmese men during World War II. </p>
<p>The soldier had pleaded for mercy and his life, to no avail. </p>
<p>Stevenson suggested that Ma Win Tar’s deformities matched the loss <a id="p131"></a>of fingers the soldier would have incurred had he held up his hands to protect  himself  from  a  blow  from  a  sword  or  to  plead  for  mercy, although  it  is  also  possible  that  like  other  soldiers,  he  had  been tortured and his fingers had been chopped off prior to the execution. </p>
<p>The pattern of grooves on Ma Win Tar’s  fingers  and  left  wrist  were presumed to be related to the rope marks from being tied to the tree. </p>
<p>At  the  age  of  three,  Ma  Win  Tar  was  accidentally  scalded  with boiling  water.  Perhaps  this  was  a  synchronicity  of  the  variety  just discussed  or  maybe  it  was  merely  a  coincidence.  Either  way,  she subsequently developed a phobia of hot objects and fire. </p>
<p>When Ma Win Tar was learning to speak, her parents would point to an object and give the name in Burmese, encouraging her to repeat it. Instead, she often spoke a foreign word that her parents couldn’t understand.  Later,  as  a  young  child,  she  sang  songs  in  a  strange tongue  unknown  to  her  family.  The  music  was  also  unfamiliar  to them.  It  is  not  known  if  Ma  Win  Tar  was  speaking  and  singing Japanese. </p>
<p>With regards to other behaviors, Ma Win Tar manifested traits that were masculine in that she preferred to dress as a boy, wore her hair short,  and  was  an  aggressive  and  violent  playmate  when  she  was young. Notably, she had a tendency to slap other children across the face,  a  behavior  characteristic  of  Japanese  soldiers  but  quite  rare amongst the Burmese. </p>
<p>Before she became conditioned to the Burmese way of life, Ma Win Tar  also  exhibited  a  number  of  other  inherently  Japanese  traits, expressing a preference for raw foods, for sitting on the ground in the traditional  Japanese  posture  and  an  aptitude  for  hard  work,  for example.  She  rejected  out  of  hand  many  of  the  Burmese  customs, refusing to perform the gesture of obeisance upon meeting a Buddhist monk or to adopt the Buddhist teaching of avoiding taking the lives of animals and insects. </p>
<p>Finally,  her  mother  reported  that  Ma  Win  Tar  had  a  liking  for firearms that was considered to be unconventional, to say the least, in Burmese girls. Once, when her brother showed her part of a firearm he had brought back to the house, she immediately understood how its mechanism worked. Twice she expressed an interest in becoming a soldier.

<p><a id="p132"></a> <i><b>If we continue to confine a search for the solutions to the riddles of human life to the conventional, accepted, materialistic paradigm for  existence,  we  shall  probably  continue  to  fail  to  find  them.  Increasingly,  we  need  to  start  looking  to  the  broader,  multidimensional, multiserial context of existence, wherein the keys to  understanding  the  more  elaborate  complexities  of  our  existence lie. This fact is demonstrated amply in the case of Ma Win Tar. </b></i></p>
