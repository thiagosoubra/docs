<p>Benefits of the Out-of-Body Experience</p>
<p>It  is  my  hope  that  this  book  has  succeeded  in  some  measure  in alleviating  general  ignorance  of  conscious  projection  and  raising awareness  of  the  fact  that,  far  from  being  a  mystical  phenomenon worthy only of scepticism and ridicule, it has been researched, studied and  practiced  for  thousands  of  years,  and  thanks  to  the  efforts  of many  leading-edge  thinkers  throughout  history,  it  is  nowadays  very well understood. </p>
<p>Beyond  this,  however,  the  primary  objective  of  this  book  is  to inform you of the many benefits of the out-of-body experience and to impress upon you that lucid projection merits a place in the modern, everyday lives of all of us. </p>
<p>So before proceeding with the chapters in which I will describe how to  achieve  your  own  OBEs,  it  is  worth  summarizing  here  the numerous  benefits  of  being  able  to  experience  your  awareness independently of your physical body. </p>
<p> <i><b>This information will help clarify in your own mind why you are trying to leave the body and will act as a powerful incentive to do so,  which in turn, will increase your chances of success. </b></i></p>
