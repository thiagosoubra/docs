<p><a id="p58"></a> <i>Chapter Three</i></p>
<p>Nonphysical Beings: Transdimensional</p>
<p>Interactions and Relationships</p>
<p>Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are. </p>
<p>—James Allen</p>
<p>We don’t change when we die. The deactivation of the physical body simply means that the nature of our  <i>manifestation</i> has changed so that we can no longer manifest in the physical dimension and the focus of our attention shifts back to the extraphysical dimension. Think of it as a change of address! </p>
<p>Nor does the process of physical death have any bearing on one’s actual level of evolution—for better or worse. When we discard our biological  body,  our  weak  traits,  strong  traits,  intelligences, pathologies, fears, beliefs, attitudes and ideas accompany us. Because of this, the behavior we see expressed in the extraphysical dimensions related  to  earth  is  nothing  more  than  human  nature  …  the  same human  nature  that  we  deal  with  every  single  day  in  our  physical world. </p>
<p>It  has  been  interesting  to  witness  over  time  how  the  portrayal  of this  reality  in  the  mainstream  entertainment  media  has  become increasingly  accurate.  Whereas  once,  extraphysical  consciousnesses were  typecast  as  terrifying  poltergeists,  now  we  are  more  regularly being  treated  to  productions  that  are  both  technically  correct  and sympathetic in their portrayal of how extraphysical beings cope with life after death. Some good examples of films of this genre are  <i>Truly, Madly, Deeply; Ghost; The Sixth Sense; The Others; Field of Dreams; Made in Heaven</i> and  <i>What Dreams May Come. </i></p>
<p>But  the  extraphysical  realms  are  not  only  inhabited  by consciousnesses  that  were  recently  human.  Some  haven’t  had  a physical existence as a human being for many centuries while others have  never  been  human  but  have  led  physical  existences  on  other planets in other parts of the universe. </p>
<p><a id="p59"></a>This may sound incredulous, but consider this: The reincarnation of the  consciousness  is  a  fundamental  principle  not  only  of conscientiology  but  of  many  philosophies  and  religions.  But  if reincarnation  is  confined  to  the  rebirth  of  a  consciousness  who  has already  lived  a  human  existence  then  how  can  we  account  for  the phenomenal growth in the earth’s population from an estimated 300 million 2,000 years ago to 6.5 billion today? As stated by Peter and Elizabeth  Fenwick  in   <i>Past  Lives:  An  Investigation  into  Reincarnation Memories</i> the planet’s ever-increasing population “makes a nonsense of the  argument  that  every  one  of  us  has  lived  another  human  life before.” ( <i>Peter and Elizabeth Fenwick</i>, 1999) To date, conventional science has had little success in detecting the presence of intelligent life on other planets, but numerous conscious projectors,  including  Waldo  Vieira,  Wagner  Alegretti  and  Robert Monroe, among others, have visited planets outside our solar system where they have interacted with a variety of intelligent physical life forms and have met countless extraphysical consciousnesses out of the body who had physical incarnations on other planets in previous lives. </p>
<p>When we consider these facts along with what we already know about human  nature,  the  sheer  scale  of  the  diversity  of  extraphysical consciousnesses quickly becomes apparent. </p>
<p>In  recognition  of  the  complexity  of  the  various  areas  of  research, the science of conscientiology regularly uses basic categorizations to facilitate  understanding  of  subjects  under  investigation.  In  this instance,  conscientiology  begins  the  process  of  classifying extraphysical  consciousnesses  by  dividing  them  into  three  groups, termed helpers, blind guides and intruders. </p>
<p><b>Helpers</b></p>
<p> <i>Helper</i>  is  a  nonmystical,  nonreligious  term  used  to  describe  an extraphysical consciousness who acts as a benefactor to one or more physical individuals. </p>
<p>A helper is sufficiently mature and personally versed in the reality of physical life and the process of individual growth so that he has an overview of the life of and opportunities available to the people he is supporting. </p>
<p> <i><b>A  helper’s  task  is  not  to  assist  a  person  to  have  an  easier,  more comfortable  life,  but  to  support  and  assist  him  to  take  maximum  <a id="p60"></a>advantage of the opportunities offered by the current physical life to become  more  aware  of  multidimensional  realities,  to  grow  and evolve  throughout  the  entirety  of  his  physical  and  extraphysical existences and to eventually undertake to help others to do the same. </b></i></p>
<p>More popularly known as angels, guardian angels, spirit guides or mentors,  helpers  are  not  mystical  beings  as  is  commonly  thought. </p>
<p>They  are  like  us,  only  in  a  better  condition,  more  advanced  or evolved.  They  have  had  physical  lives  and  will  have  again.  Some people  currently  living  among  us  were  helpers  in  previous nonphysical periods spent between lives. </p>
<p><b>Characteristics and Behaviors of Helpers</b></p>
<p>Notable characteristics and behaviors of helpers include the following:</p>
<p>•  They are fully aware that they have discarded the physical body  (i.e.  passed  through  the  first  death)  and  because  of  this, have discarded their energy body (i.e. passed through the second death). </p>
<p>•  Their raison d’être, as their name suggests, is to assist others. </p>
<p>Assistance is their specialty. They have the intention to assist in all circumstances and conditions and can fulfill their intentions in many cases. </p>
<p>•  While they genuinely care for us, they are not dependent on us nor  do  they  create  situations  in  which  we  become  dependent upon  them.  One  of  the  ways  they  do  this  is  by  not  helping  us every  time  they  can.  They  have  the  capability  to  solve  most  of our  problems,  but  if  they  were  to  do  this,  we  would  become reliant  on  them.  They  understand  that  it  is  only  in  making  our own decisions and dealing with the consequences of our choices that we grow. So they provide assistance when appropriate and necessary but otherwise they step back and just monitor us. </p>
<p>•  They work in discreet ways. They won’t, for example, show themselves  to  us.  If  we  could  see  them  so  easily  we  would  be calling on them for help all the time and not learning how to help ourselves. </p>
<p>•  They are not demanding of us. They don’t demand that we improve or develop ourselves. It is our always our choice. </p>
<p>•  They respect our free will, never applying pressure, forcing or <a id="p61"></a>imposing anything on us. </p>
<p>•  They analyze us but don’t judge us. </p>
<p>•    They  manifest  a  heightened  level  of  awareness—meaning they  have  deliberately  been  using  their  mental  body  more  over many  physical  and  extraphysical  lives  to  seek  and  have  new experiences  from  which  they  have  learned  and  grown  as consciousnesses. </p>
<p>•    Being  in  contact  with  helpers  generates  an  increase  in  our lucidity and rationality. For example, you may be about to make a critical decision and many ideas and suggestions come to you. </p>
<p>Imagine  you  are  working  with  an  aid  organization  in  a  third-world country and you find that you don’t have enough medicine and  food  to  keep  everyone  alive,  so  you  have  to  decide  who receives the assistance and who doesn’t. The helpers will help you to think with rationality and to consider all the consequences of the possible decisions or may give you an intuition about other alternative solutions to the problem. </p>
<p>•    They  have  specific  skills.  For  example,  if  you  want  to  help homeless people, a helper who has experience with this will come to assist you. If you want to do medical research to find a cure for a  disease,  a  helper  who  has  expertise  in  this  field  will  come  to work with you. </p>
<p>•    Their  behavior  is  always  cosmoethical—meaning,  their behavior is aligned with more evolved moral principles that are not  subjective  in  nature  or  specific  to  one  particular  culture  or religion, but are applicable and appropriate in all circumstances, cultures,  countries,  continents  and  dimensions.  (The  subject  of cosmoethics is explored in depth in<a href="index_split_002_split2.html#p173"> chapter 11)</a>. </p>
<p>•  They never assist us to do something that is not cosmoethical. </p>
<p>•  They don’t help us at the cost of someone else. </p>
<p>•  They know what our specific purpose in life is. They give us tips  about  our  life  task  and  provide  us  with  opportunities  to increase our awareness of this important aspect of our lives until we know what we have to do. </p>
<p>•  We almost always have karmic connections with our helpers. </p>
<p><a id="p62"></a>Not  everyone  has  helpers.  This  reality  conflicts  with  the  mystical notion that everyone has his own personal guardian angel watching over him. But serial killers, dictators who commit genocide, terrorists, pedophiles and drug traffickers, for example, don’t have helpers. But if a moment arrives in the lives of people like this when they begin to reflect,  turn  inwards  and  start  working  on  self-improvement  with some commitment and perseverance, they would attract the attention of the helpers. </p>
<p>Helpers  are  not  with  us  around  the  clock  but  are  with  us  when we’re  in  need  and  when  we’re  doing  things  that  are  related  to  our development and growth. They’re always giving assistance, so when we’re just taking time out to relax or when we’re engaged in activities that  are  not  cosmoethical,  they’re  off  making  best  use  of  their  time helping someone else. </p>
<p>We don’t always have the same helper with us throughout our life. </p>
<p>There  are  several  reasons  for  this.  Some  helpers  specialize,  for example,  in  protecting  children.  Others  specialize  in  fields  such  as projectiology  (assisting  interested,  cosmoethical  individuals  to  leave the body with lucidity), evolution, research, or the dissemination of ideas. As we develop and evolve, we may need more advanced helpers or simply helpers with different areas of expertise. Sometimes helpers leave us to be reborn. </p>
<p>It  is  possible  to  learn  to  perceive  the  presence  of  the  helpers  if you’re not able to do so already. Tips and techniques for developing your  parapsychic  capacities  to  the  point  where  you  can  accurately discern who is around you extraphysically are discussed at length in the next chapter. </p>
<p><b>How Can I Have More Helpers Around Me? </b></p>
<p>But what if you perceive that you don’t have many helpers close to you? If this is your case and you would like to enhance and increase the frequency of your interactions with helpers, you will attract them to you by being more like them. Remember, who we have around us both  physically  and  extraphysically  is  a  function  of  affinities—like attracts like. So if we spend more time trying to improve and develop ourselves,  and  assisting  others  by  happily  giving  of  our  time, attention, love, energy, wisdom, money (when appropriate) and any of the many other resources we have at our disposal, we will attract <a id="p63"></a>helpers to us. When we help others we create an atmosphere around us with our positive thoughts and intentions that allows the helpers to be  close  to  us.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  we  surround  ourselves  with physical and extraphysical consciousnesses whose attitudes, intentions and behaviors are negative, the helpers can’t get close to us. </p>
<p>One important thing to remember about the helpers is that as they are specialists in assistance, they know their job much better than we do. So we can ask our helpers to help someone else but if we ask them to help us, we are, in effect, telling them that they don’t know how to do  their  job.  This  shows  a  lack  of  appreciation.  Nor  should  we constantly make demands of them. They are not our servants and they merit more respect than that. </p>
<p><b>Mechanisms by Which Helpers Communicate with Us</b> The helpers use a variety of mechanisms to intervene in our lives and to communicate with us. Here are some examples. </p>
<p><b>Synchronicity</b></p>
<p>Reports of an unseen force assisting people at a critical point in their lives  are  not  uncommon.  My  good  friend  Sam,  for  example,  was vacationing with his family on Phuket in Thailand when the tsunami struck on Boxing Day, 2004, and through a long sequence of unlikely synchronicities,  they  all  escaped  with  their  lives.  First,  as  they  had decided  to  spend  Christmas  in  Thailand  at  the  last  minute,  all  the beachfront  hotels  were  fully  booked  so  they  stayed  at  Club  Med, which was set back from the beach and raised on the incline of a hill. </p>
<p>Second, having enjoyed spending all of Christmas Day playing on the beach, they decided to spend the following day there as well. As they were passing the pool on the way to the beach Sam’s daughter jumped in, laughing. So he got in with her. It was only minutes later that the first wave struck. Third, the hotel pool wasn’t on ground level but was on the first floor. Sam’s girlfriend, having just finished a yoga class on the ground floor, was making her way up the stairs to the pool when the  wave  struck,  and  was  out  of  harm’s  way.  Fourth,  and  to  their immense credit, Club Med had full emergency evacuation procedures in place and rather than abandoning their guests, the staff put them into  practice.  The  surviving  guests  were  guided  to  the  safety  of  a monastery  on  top  of  the  hill  as  soon  as  the  first  wave  subsided,  a collection of passports from the hotel rooms was organized during the <a id="p64"></a>night, and four Air France aircraft were flown especially from Paris to Bangkok and then onto Phuket as soon as the airport reopened. The Club Med guests were on the first planes out of the country the next day. </p>
<p>Was it the helpers hard at work in the days leading up to and then during the disaster that kept my friends safe? Unfortunately, with an event  of  such  magnitude  it  would  be  impossible  for  the  helpers  to protect everybody. </p>
<p>While  some  people  have  some  level  of  awareness  of  the  direct intervention of a helper in a moment of need or crisis, most people interpret  synchronicities  that  bring  about  positive  outcomes  in  their lives as good luck. </p>
<p>Helpers  may  also  use  synchronicities  as  a  means  of  providing  us with some inspirations and ideas. </p>
<p><b>Secondary Messenger</b></p>
<p>Perhaps  you  have  had  an  experience  in  which  a  person  acted  as  a "secondary messenger” of the helpers and passed you a message that didn’t make any sense to them but made perfect sense and was very helpful to you. </p>
<p>I had this happen several years ago when I was out to dinner one night with a man who later became my partner. At that time we were not  involved  but  were  having  a  lovely  dinner  and  a  great  chat. </p>
<p>Towards the end of the night, the group of people at the table next to us, with whom we’d talked a little throughout the evening, stood up to leave. One of the men leaned very close over our table, between us, and said, “You two have a fantastic connection.” He looked each of us square in the eyes and said, “If only you’d realize it.” All three of us were quite stunned by what he said, considering he was a complete stranger  who  had  no  way  of  knowing  what  the  nature  of  our relationship was or wasn’t. But along with all the other pieces in the complicated jigsaw of relationships, it helped bring us together. </p>
<p><b>Intuition</b></p>
<p>Have  you  ever  been  struck  by  an  intuition  so  strong  that  you  felt compelled to act upon it? Sometimes the helpers use this mechanism of communication to do things like prevent accidents, large or small, and even to save lives. Wagner Alegretti was on the receiving end of <a id="p65"></a>just  such  an  intervention  when  he  was  a  small  baby.  He  was  lying asleep in a bassinet under a massive set of kitchen cabinets when all of  a  sudden  his  mother,  who  was  ironing  on  the  other  side  of  the room, was struck by a powerful instinct to rush over and snatch him from  the  bassinet,  which  she  did.  Seconds  later,  the  entire  shelving unit  laden  with  crockery,  pots  and  pans,  and  other  heavy  kitchen equipment  collapsed  and  fell  from  the  wall,  crushing  the  bassinet beneath it. </p>
<p>The  film   <i>Touching  the  Void</i>  also  portrays  an  excellent  example  of how  a  helper  might  intervene  through  the  mechanism  of  intuition. </p>
<p>The film recounts the true story of two climbers and their treacherous assault  on  the  Siula  Grande  in  the  Peruvian  Andes  in  1985. </p>
<p>Disturbingly,  Englishman  Simon  Yates  had  to  sacrifice  the  life  of friend Joe Simpson in order to save his own when a storm struck soon after  their  descent  from  the  summit.  As  this  occurred  during  a whiteout  and  at  night,  Simon  wasn’t  to  know  that  Joe  actually survived after being released from a rope, falling over a cliff and into a ravine. </p>
<p>When Simon eventually reached the base camp, which was nothing more  than  a  backpacker  they’d  met  on  their  travels  waiting  with  a tent  and  some  food,  he  felt  strangely  compelled  to  linger,  which  he and  backpacker  Richard  Hawking  did  for  four  days.  This  seemed incongruous in light of the ordeal he had just suffered and was against Richard’s wishes. On the fourth night however, the two men woke to hear Joe, who had maneuvered his way out of a deep ravine despite hideous  injuries  to  one  leg,  descended  thousands  of  feet  down  the mountain  and  then  crawled  several  kilometers  over  rocks  in excruciating pain and with severe dehydration, hunger, frostbite and then delirium, to reach the camp, despite fully expecting that no one would be there. </p>
<p>What was it that compelled Simon to stay? What was it that drove Joe to overcome the utter hopelessness of his circumstances and inch his way down the mountain? In Joe’s case, as he later admitted that he hates to be defeated and is incredibly strong-willed, it seems to me that  the  helpers  took  advantage  of  these  strong  traits  by  amplifying them with suggestions to keep moving forward, one painful step at a time. </p>
<p>In  a  chapter  of   <i>Projections  of  the  Consciousness</i>  entitled  “Ideal <a id="p66"></a>Assistance,” Waldo Vieira describes a projection to a neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro in which he met an extraphysical man, a helper, who appeared to be a doctor. Through the process of telepathy, the helper explained that his regular work involved assisting consciousnesses in need  and  spoke  of  his  plans  to  expand  the  team  he  currently coordinated  to  regularly  incorporate  projected  individuals  whose dense energies would greatly facilitate the work. (As the helpers have passed through the second death and discarded the energy body, they need  and  use  the  dense  energies  of  projectors  in  order  to  carry  out certain types of assistance.)</p>
<p>The helper told Waldo that his team, which is more active at night when  human  suffering  tends  to  be  most  acute,  from  6:00  p.m. onwards,  works  with  the  problems  that  arise  from  the  loosely structured  relationships  typical  of  big  cities,  such  as  loneliness  and sadness, depression and despair, doubts, longings and resentments. </p>
<p>Before  leaving  Waldo,  the  helper  conveyed  to  him  this  message related  to  ideal  assistance.  Waldo  recounted  it  in   <i>Projections  of  the Consciousness</i> and I think it’s pertinent to quote it here: Every  act  of  social  assistance,  no  matter  how  small,  signifies fraternity,  is  productive  and  deserves  praise.  Any  kind  of  human assistance  is  better  than  none.  Nevertheless,  the  ideal  social assistance has its own unmistakable universalistic characteristics. </p>
<p>It is not official since it is spontaneous. </p>
<p>It is not a tax deductible donation. </p>


<p class="calibre1" id="top">It does not have a professional title. </p>
<p>It has no secondary or political intentions. </p>
<p>It does not back a personal image or cultivate myths. </p>
<p>It does not encourage segregation of any kind. </p>
<p>It is not restricted by prejudice. </p>
<p>It does not expect gratitude nor require public understanding. </p>
<p>It  does  not  disseminate  the  act  of  assistance,  regardless  of circumstances. </p>
<p>It  is  the  donation  of  one’s  self—simple,  pure  and  direct—without <a id="p67"></a>mediation, demands or conditions. And everyone can practice it in silence. (Vieira, 2007)</p>
<p><b>Blind Guides</b></p>
<p>Blind  guides  are  nonphysical  consciousnesses  who  know  us  from previous  lives.  They  may  have  been  our  spouses,  partners,  lovers, siblings,  children,  parents,  friends,  neighbors  or  colleagues.  Perhaps we were even followers of theirs once, or vice versa. Our blind guides cannot be objective in the way they relate to us because of the strong connections,  associations  and  links  between  us  that  stem  from  the history, affinities, emotions and karma that we share. Blind guides are people just like us, with more or less the same level of evolution as us. </p>
<p><b>Characteristics and Behaviors of Blind Guides</b></p>
<p>Notable  characteristics  and  behaviors  of  blind  guides  include  the following:</p>
<p>•  Some have only passed through the first death, meaning they are unaware that they are no longer alive in the physical sense and, consequently, have not discarded their dense energy body. </p>
<p>Others have passed through the second death, and are aware of their nonphysical condition. </p>
<p>•    Their  intentions  are  neither  intrinsically  positive  nor negative. Although in their own minds their intentions are good, they show no discernment. </p>
<p>•  They like us but often disregard our free will. </p>
<p>•  Their behavior is not always cosmoethical. </p>
<p>•  They do not know what our specific purpose in life is. </p>
<p>•  They have about the same level of evolution as us. </p>
<p>So  blind  guides  can  be  best  described  as  extraphysical  beings  with poor lucidity  and objectivity  who  are not  very advanced  or  mature. </p>
<p>They are blind in terms of evolution. </p>
<p>Typically,  blind  guides  want  what’s  best  for  us  but  due  to  the personal  nature  of  their  relationship  with  us  they  aren’t  capable  of analyzing objectively what that is. They use whatever resources they have at their disposal to produce outcomes in our lives based on their own  subjective  opinion  of  what  helping  means,  and  this  may  not <a id="p68"></a>always be what’s best for us or what we want. </p>
<p>For example, sometimes former family members (both of this life or previous lives) don’t approve of our choice of partner so try to create events  that  appear  to  be  coincidences  or  synchronicities  in  order  to block the relationship. </p>
<p>To draw another analogy with physical life, imagine a person has good intentions and wants to help a sick friend by performing surgery on her, but he has no medical training. He will surely end up harming his friend. Blind guides are like that. </p>
<p>Knowing  that  our  blind  guides  are  “on  our  side”  so  to  speak  and supportive  of  us,  we  should  always  be  careful  of  what  we  wish  for others,  because  our  blind  guides  may  try  to  carry  out  our  wishes. </p>
<p>People  who  were  leaders  in  previous  lives  are  particularly  likely  to notice  some  “coincidences”  in  which  their  unspoken  resentments towards others are fulfilled, because they probably have blind guides around  them  who  were  their  followers  in  previous  lives  and  are accustomed to carrying out their orders. </p>
<p>Blind  guides  can  also  assist  others,  but  unlike  the  helpers,  are unable  to  be  detached  from  the  circumstances  in  which  they  find themselves  and  usually  indulge  their  personal  preferences.  So  the assistance  they  lend  is  more  like  an  indoctrination  whereas  real assistance respects the individuality and free will of the person being helped. </p>
<p><b>Intruders</b></p>
<p>I  begin  this  section  by  acknowledging  the  additional,  significant research and development of Vieira’s work on the subject of intrusion, carried  out  by  Wagner  Alegretti  and  Nanci  Trivellato.  Alegretti  and Trivellato  offer  a  40-hour  course  on  becoming  permanently,  totally free  of  intrusion,  and  many  of  the  ideas  they  have  contributed  are explored in this chapter. </p>
<p>I  have  given  more  emphasis  to  this  category  of  extraphysical consciousnesses so you will find this section longer than the others. If we can develop a solid understanding of the process of intrusion, how it can destabilize our lives, and even the role that we play in allowing it, we are presented with many unique and invaluable opportunities to exercise  more  control  over  our  daily  experience  of  life.  All  this  will <a id="p69"></a>become clear as you read on. </p>
<p>The  term  “intruder,”  which  applies  equally  to  physical consciousnesses  as  to  extraphysical  consciousnesses,  is  used  to describe  someone  who,  intentionally  or  otherwise,  negatively influences  another  through  the  transference  of  a  combination  of  his thoughts,  emotions  and  energy.  This  transference  occurs  when  two consciousnesses  are  drawn  together  through  common  underlying feelings  and  couple  aurically  through  the  fusion  of  their  energetic fields,  a  concept  that  will  be  described  in  the  next  chapter  on bioenergy. </p>
<p>Intrusion can occur in the following combinations:</p>
<p>•    An  intrusion  of  one  physical  consciousness  on  another physical consciousness</p>
<p>•  An intrusion of an extraphysical consciousness on a physical consciousness, and vice versa</p>
<p>•    An  intrusion  that  occurs  between  two  extraphysical consciousnesses</p>
<p>As  this  chapter  is  about  nonphysical  beings,  it  is  the  extraphysical intruders and the ways in which they relate to human beings that are of particular interest to us here. But it is interesting to note the other combinations of intrusion as they help us to see that intrusion occurs naturally within and across dimensions and is also very much a part of the human condition. </p>
<p>To give just a few examples, as humans we intrude on others when we compete for power, force others to put up with our shortcomings and limitations; are manipulative, greedy, picky, insistent, interfering and selfish; when we gossip, impose our ideas on others, try to change others, prioritize our own gratification and rob others of their energy. </p>
<p>In  the  case  of  extraphysical  intruders,  we  may  not  see  or  even perceive them but they are just as able to exert a negative influence over us and steal our energies as humans. </p>
<p> <i><b>Intrusion, physical and extraphysical, is all about human nature— a reality we deal with every day. For this reason, without trivializing the seriousness of it, intrusion shouldn’t overly frighten or worry us.  In  the  same  way  that  helpers  are  just  like  us  only  more  evolved,  intruders are also just like us, only more pathological. </b></i></p>
<p><a id="p70"></a><b>Characteristics and Behaviors of Intruders</b> Notable  characteristics  of  extraphysical  intruders  include  the following:</p>
<p>•    Only  a  small  minority  are  lucid  as  to  their  nonphysical condition and have passed through the second death (discarded the energy body). </p>
<p>•  As the majority of them still have their energy body, they are "energivorous,”  meaning,  they  lack  and  are  in  need  of  dense energy from the physical environment. They get the energy they need from living beings. </p>
<p>•  Because of this, most of them dwell in the crustal dimension that overlaps with earth. </p>
<p>•  Most of them are not evil, just needy. </p>
<p>•    Because  they  can  only  connect  with  us  when  we  share affinities  with  them,  they  are  particularly  competent  at amplifying emotions and thoughts that we already have. </p>
<p><b>Why Do Intruders Intrude on Us? </b></p>
<p>So  why  do  extraphysical  consciousnesses  intrude  on  us?  In  the  vast majority  of  cases,  the  intruders  are  unaware  that  they’re  no  longer alive in the physical sense, they are still carrying their dense energy body,  and  they  are  living  within  the  earth’s  paratroposphere. </p>
<p>Although the energies there are relatively dense as far as extraphysical environments  go,  they  are  very  subtle  compared  to  the  physical dimension. These intruders are not able to absorb the thin energy of the  paratroposphere  and  so  intrude  on  humans  to  take  from  us  the energy that they need, energy that we have pre-processed and make readily available as most of us have no notion of these realities and therefore  no  knowledge  of  how  to  prevent  our  energy  from  being stolen.  Although  this  sort  of  intrusion  is  not  intentional,  when intruders steal our energy, they harm us to a greater or lesser extent. </p>
<p>I  realize  that  this  may  sound  alarming  for  some  of  you.  Please remember that many extraphysical intruders were once alive, walking among us and that there are also physical intruders around us in our normal,  everyday  lives.  Fearing  coming  into  contact  with extraphysical  intruders  is  therefore  the  same  as  fearing  coming  into <a id="p71"></a>contact with humans. To give an example, do you have any “friends" who  call  you  when  they  are  down  or  in  difficulty  and  alleviate  the stress  they’re  feeling  by  “unloading”  their  problems  on  you?  The exchange is not mutual. There is no reciprocity. It is them demanding your time and attention, support, sympathy and energy. So they are stealing  your  energy.  But  do  you  fear  it?  No.  Likewise,  there  is nothing  to  fear  from  the  same  process  occurring  across  the dimensions. Nonetheless, as I stated before, when intruders steal our energy,  they  take  something  from  us  that  we  shouldn’t  knowingly give, so there is much to be gained from learning how to prevent it. </p>
<p>There are several effective techniques for dealing with intrusion that will be discussed later in this chapter, but first let’s look at some other forms of intrusion. </p>
<p>In some cases, the intruders are aware of their condition and know exactly  what  they  are  doing.  They  intrude  on  humans  in  order  to satisfy  hungers  and  craving  for  specific  sensations,  thoughts  and emotions.  For  example,  if  an  extraphysical  intruder  was  addicted  to sex  in  previous  physical  lives  and  didn’t  manage  to  overcome  the addiction,  he  will  still  be  in  a  condition  in  which  he  can  think  of nothing but sex. So he intrudes on humans who share these appetites in  order  to  feed  his  insatiable  psychological  need  for  sexual  energy and  the  sensations  that  accompany  sexual  activity.  Prostitutes  and others who  are promiscuous  would  be likely  targets for  intrusion  of this variety. </p>
<p>In this context, anything we are addicted to is a problem, be it love, money,  a  house,  a  person,  alcohol  or  drugs,  because  we  attract intruders to us who share our addiction. </p>
<p>For  example,  pathological  love  is  a  fairly  common  cause  of intrusion. Sometimes when a person dies, he craves the energies and affection of a former lover to whom he was pathologically attached or addicted. The separation causes him to be in such a state of despair that he intrudes on his former partner, stealing his or her energy and the emotional and mental information it carries. </p>
<p>Possessiveness  is  another  relatively  common  cause  of  intrusion. </p>
<p>Post-mortem  parapsychotics  who  don’t  know  that  they’re  dead  and are  very  attached  to  the  places  where  they  previously  lived  can become extremely agitated and resentful when newcomers move into their  former  homes.  If  they  can  access  and  process  enough  dense <a id="p72"></a>energy  to  produce  outcomes  in  the  physical  environment (psychokinesis  or  PK)  intended  to  scare  off  the  human  “interlopers" they  become  what  are  known  as  poltergeists.  The  film   <i>The  Others</i> demonstrates  the  motivations  behind  this  particular  poltergeist phenomenon very well. </p>
<p>In  other  instances,  our  intruders  might  try  to  pressure  us  to  do different things that we greatly enjoyed doing together in a previous life  such  as  getting  very  drunk,  controlling  or  manipulating  the opposite sex, or being obnoxious and arrogant. More lucid intruders can also pressure us to produce intense emotions and thoughts as the energy  we  generate  when  we  experience  certain  emotions  can  be extremely  powerful  and  attractive  to  them  in  their  pathological condition. </p>
<p>Some intruders have a dark sense of humor and play with humans for no better reason than to amuse themselves, in much the same way that  bullies  tease  young  children,  are  cruel  to  animals,  or  vandalize the property of others. </p>
<p><b>Common Symptoms of Intrusion</b></p>
<p>There are many different symptoms or effects that may suggest we are under  intrusion,  but  I  can’t  emphasize  enough  here  that  these  very same symptoms may have other causes that are in no way related to intrusion. Not every human problem, mistake or accident is caused by intrusion. </p>
<p>Common symptoms of intrusion include:</p>
<p>•  Feeling weak or energetically drained</p>
<p>•  Unexplained tiredness or exhaustion (which can manifest as sleeping at any time in any place)</p>
<p>•  Insomnia</p>
<p>•  Sensing a heavy weight on the shoulders</p>
<p>•  An abrupt and/or extreme change of mood</p>
<p>•  Unexpected temperamental outbursts</p>
<p>•  Fixed ideas or memories that play over and over</p>
<p>•  Anxiety</p>
<p><a id="p73"></a>•  Confusion</p>
<p>•  Unjustified irritability</p>
<p>•  Some headaches</p>
<p>•  Accident-proneness</p>
<p>•  Anger, rage and bad temper</p>
<p>•  Laughing or crying without cause</p>
<p>•  Persistently bothering others</p>
<p>•  Provoking pointless arguments</p>
<p>•  Some nightmares</p>
<p>•  Fear</p>
<p>•  Laziness</p>
<p>•  Extreme lack of motivation</p>
<p>•  Feeling that something is wrong when it’s not</p>
<p>•  Talking to oneself</p>
<p>•  A sensation of apprehension or imminent catastrophe</p>
<p>•  Bad humor and sarcasm</p>
<p>•  Pessimism</p>
<p>•  Loss of perspective</p>
<p>•  Violence</p>
<p>•  Sudden crazy thoughts (Trivellato and Alegretti, 2003–2004) We  have  to  learn  to  distinguish  when  these  symptoms  are  totally unrelated  to  intrusion  and  have  perfectly  rational  explanations  and when they are the result of intrusion. For example, if we are feeling irritable  maybe  it’s  because  a  minor  incident  occurred  at  our workplace that annoyed us initially. An intruder then couples with us energetically,  contaminates  us  with  his  thoughts  and  magnifies  the irritation until it is way out of proportion with the event that caused it.  He  then  takes  the  energy  charged  with  the  irritation  that  we produce, if this is what he likes. Or maybe we are irritated because we are hungry, tired, cold or suffering from menstrual pains. So while we have to be aware that intrusion is a reality, we have to be balanced, </p>
<p><a id="p74"></a><img src="index-74_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p>discerning and aware that not everything is intrusion. </p>
<p><b>How to Detect Intrusion</b></p>
<p>Vieira has been very interested over the years to try to establish some figures  that  more  or  less  accurately  represent  the  proportion  of extraphysical  consciousnesses  to  physical  people.  After  discussions with high-level helpers on exactly this topic over several decades and according  to  his  own  extensive  experience  out  of  the  body,  he estimates that for every physical person on this planet there are nine extraphysical  beings.  I  repeat—these  figures  are  didactical approximations. No one has yet found a way to perform a census of the  extraphysical  population.  It  is  the  best  we  know  for  the  time being. </p>
<p>But  if  for  now  we  consider  that  the  extraphysical  population  is significantly greater than the human population, and that we always have some extraphysical beings around us, some more or less at our level  (blind  guides),  some  more  advanced  (helpers)  and  some pathological  (intruders),  then  we  need  to  learn  how  to  distinguish who is with us at any given moment in time, in order to be able to recognize  when  we  are  being  intruded—the  first  important  step towards stopping it from happening. </p>
<p><b>Whether we are conscious of it or not, we are never alone. </b></p>
<p><a id="p75"></a>One way of becoming more perceptive of who is around us is to pay attention  to  the  sensations  we  experience  and  the  thoughts  and emotions  we’re  having  at  the  moment,  then  five  minutes  later  and again twenty minutes later. Ask yourself how you feel. If you have a helper close to you, some of the sensations you might experience are a sense of calmness, serenity and well-being; you feel more relaxed and that  everything’s  OK.  Similarly,  your  thoughts  and  emotions  are balanced  and  positive.  When  you’re  feeling  down  or  negative,  and experiencing any of the symptoms of intrusion listed in the previous section, intruders or blind guides may be there with you. </p>
<p><b>The Mechanism behind Intrusion</b></p>
<p>To help us understand the mechanism of intrusion, just as we attract helpers to us when we behave like them, intruders intrude on us when we  behave,  think  or  feel  like  them.  In  other  words,  intruders  can’t produce  a  certain  response  or  reaction  from  us  from  nothing.  What they can do is amplify or pressure us to exaggerate the thoughts and feelings that we already have. </p>
<p>If we consider the fact that consciousnesses from both dimensions resonate  with  each  other  as  they  exchange,  knowingly  or unknowingly,  thoughts,  feelings,  intentions,  ideas,  beliefs,  attitudes and energy, etc., then these are the points of connection that link us to  and  determine  our  extraphysical  company.  As  Vieira  explains  in <i>Projections  of  the  Consciousness</i>,  “An  empty  brain  cannot  be  directly influenced.”  ( <i>Vieira</i>,  1997)  So  we  can  say  therefore,  that  every intrusion starts with a self-intrusion. That’s the first problem. We have a predisposition for a certain type of energy. We have been open to it. </p>
<p>The  second  problem  is  that  an  intruder  with  a  similar  affinity  has attached himself to us energetically. So we are never completely, 100 percent a victim. We are a part of the equation based on the mental, emotional  and  energetic  affinities  we  have  with  our  extraphysical company. </p>
<p>An  example  of  how  this  might  unfold  on  a  practical  level—you might  be  having  a  normal,  average  day  when  suddenly  you  have  a passing thought that makes you feel a bit down. An intruder who has a tendency for depression couples with you energetically, exaggerates your feelings and in no time you are feeling irritable, melancholic and depressed … but you don’t know why. </p>
<p><a id="p76"></a><b>Tips and Techniques for Preventing Intrusion</b> The good news is that there are techniques—energetic exercises—that we can apply to perceive and identify our extraphysical company and defend ourselves against intrusion, such as sending out (exteriorizing) our  energies  and  the  vibrational  state.  Detailed  instructions  for applying  these  techniques  and  the  numerous  additional  benefits  of these  powerful  tools  for  energetic  self-defense  are  discussed  in  the next chapter. </p>
<p>Other effective means of dealing with intrusion include</p>
<p>•    Identifying  our  shortcomings,  i.e.  the  points  of  connection that allow the intruders to get close to us in the first place, and then  developing  a  long-term  strategy  to  overcome  them—to change. The strategy in the short-term is the vibrational state. An example  of  how  an  intrusion  may  start  with  our  own shortcomings  is  when  people  allow  themselves  to  be  intruded within intimate relationships because they prefer to put up with the intrusion (in the form of manipulation, domination, physical or verbal abuse, etc.) than to be alone. The long-term strategy for dealing with this intrusion would be to overcome the weakness that permits it in the first place. </p>
<p>•  Applying what is known as “mental hygiene,” which means to be conscious of your thoughts. When you get stuck on a negative vein of thinking that arouses your anger, frustration or sense of being unfairly treated, for example, quite literally force yourself to think of something else. Do whatever is necessary. Go and see a movie, play an absorbing computer game or go to your favorite restaurant  with  some  good  friends.  In  changing  your  thoughts, you sever the link that keeps the intruders connected to you and frees you from their influence. </p>
<p>•  Standing up and taking action against the physical intruders in  our  lives.  The  more  we’re  able  to  defend  ourselves  against intrusion  physically  the  more  we’ll  eventually  be  able  to  do  so extraphysically.  For  example,  most  of  us  know  someone  who constantly bends our ear, someone who talks and talks at us with no awareness or concern for whether or not we have the time or inclination  to  listen  to  their  trivia.  People  like  this  are  also stealing our energy. Why would we knowingly accept this? Some <a id="p77"></a>of us worry about not being nice or that others won’t like us, but we can just say firmly and politely, “Excuse me, I’m busy.” If we can’t stop someone from bending our ear at the water cooler in the office what hope do we have of getting rid of an extraphysical intruder who was our lover in a previous life? </p>
<p>•  Don’t justify the personality traits that link you to intrusion. </p>
<p>If you know a particular impulse is not correct, don’t rationalize it  to  yourself  by  saying,  “This  is  just  the  way  I  am.  This  is  my personality.” Be sincere with yourself. </p>
<p>•  The flip side of this coin is to consciously develop traits and habits  that  link  us  to  helpers.  For  example,  try  to  cultivate  an optimistic, positive attitude; evaluate the quality of your thoughts</p>
<p>—e.g.  do  you  see  the  best  in  people  first  and  then  see  their weaker points, or do you only see their failings? Practice allowing your  rationality  to  dominate  your  emotionality,  be  sincere  with yourself  and  others  and  persevere  with  your  efforts.  ( <i>Trivel ato and Alegretti</i>, 2003–2004)</p>
<p>We need to get used to the idea that we are the masters of our own reality and that we have all the power we need to change many things about  our  lives  that  we’re  not  satisfied  with.  In  essence,  what  this means  is  that  if  we  suffer  intrusion  it’s  because  we  allow  it  and putting an end to it is largely a question of will. </p>
<p>Above  all,  to  become  free  of  intrusion  is  to  know  and  apply  the highest level of cosmoethics in every thought, emotion and action. </p>
