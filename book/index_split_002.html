<p>The Evolutionary Process</p>
<p>Apply yourself both now and in the next life. Without effort, you cannot be prosperous. Though the land be good, you cannot have an abundant crop without cultivation. </p>
<p> <i>—Plato</i></p>
<p>A  third  fundamental  principle  of  conscientiology  is  that  the consciousness evolves. </p>
<p>All  life-forms  share  the  common  objective  of  evolving.  Even  the simplest single-celled organisms have a basic instinct to improve and become more complex. </p>
<p> <i><b>If we take into account the broader, more detailed picture of what it means to be a consciousness as has been described in the previous chapters, it is clear that physical life, rather than being meaningless or  arbitrary,  provides  us  with  a  sophisticated,  challenging environment that is rich in opportunities to better ourselves and to mature—in other words, to evolve. </b></i></p>
<p>Once we begin to recognize this and to purposefully engage in our evolution, life starts to take on more meaning, for the real currency of life is what lasts, what we take away with us when we die. Our status in the extraphysical dimension is not determined by how much wealth we accumulated in the previous life but by our level of evolution. So if we return to the extraphysical dimension when we die in a better condition  than  when  we  last  left  it  to  be  reborn,  and  if  we  helped others to do the same during our lifetime, then we can leave this life with the deep satisfaction of knowing that we made it count. </p>
<p>The  process  of  our  evolution  has  already  been  taking  place  for many thousands of years and it takes place wherever we are along the multiexistential cycle, bearing in mind that we are multidimensional beings—sometimes  our  focus  is  physical,  sometimes  it  is extraphysical. During all of our past lives and intermissive periods we have  had  many  experiences,  we’ve  made  mistakes  and  hopefully, <a id="p148"></a>learned something from them, we’ve acquired new intelligences and skills,  we’ve  increased  our  knowledge  of  a  range  of  subjects,  we’ve developed new capacities and attributes, we’ve experienced a variety of relationships with others, and as a result of all this we have become wiser and have evolved into more complex beings. </p>
<p>You  will  remember  from  the  previous  chapter  that  during  the process  of  rebirth  the  consciousness  suffers  a  massive  restriction  of lucidity  during  which  the  memories  of  previous  existences  are blocked. So in order to evolve, to build upon the extensive knowledge, experience  and  wisdom  that  we’ve  already  accumulated  during  our past lives, first we have to recover our awareness of what we already know. Fortunately, the process of gradually manifesting more of the personality that we really are is to some degree quite a natural one. </p>
<p>This is how it works. </p>
<p><b>Recovery of Awareness</b></p>
<p>When  a  consciousness  is  reborn,  on  the  first  day  of  life  in  the  new physical body, it has almost no awareness of itself or anything else. </p>
<p>But from that day on, each day it breathes in the new physical body, it recovers its awareness through the regular everyday experiences of life. As we grow, we experience emotions; we go to school to study our language, history, science and maths; we play games and sports; we  make  connections  with  others  and  we  start  to  develop  our  own personality.  We  recover  many  things  that  we  knew  before  and  we start to be more of who we really are. In other words our awareness starts to return. </p>
<p><b>The “Basement” of the Consciousness</b></p>
<p>The  phase  that  lasts  from  the  age  of  two  until  the  end  of  puberty, however, is when our level of awareness is at its poorest. This phase is known in conscientiology as the “basement” of the consciousness, or the   <i>consciential  basement. </i>  What  is  in  your  actual  basement?  If  it’s anything  like  mine,  it’s  probably  home  to  a  chaotic  pile  of  trunks, boxes and moldy old suitcases filled with things you don’t use or need any more, and other rubbish that should have been thrown out long ago. In a similar fashion, the consciential basement is a period during which  we  exhibit  behavior  that  will  be  of  no  use  to  us  once  we become  adults  and  that  we  need  to  get  rid  of  at  some  point.  For example,  children  love  to  play  tricks  like  ringing  old  people’s, <a id="p149"></a>doorbells then running away, just to disturb them. This shows a lack of respect for others. Most of us probably did plenty of things like this when we were young, but if we wouldn’t do them now that we are adults,  they  do  not  represent  who  we  really  are.  Take  another example. Let’s say a child likes to torture insects for fun by picking off their limbs and wings. Perhaps this is just his consciential basement. </p>
<p>But if he’s still amusing himself by torturing insects when he grows up,  if  he  hasn’t  overcome  this  tendency  from  his  consciential basement,  then  it  would  seem  that  this  behavior  represents  who  he really is—the person doesn’t respect life in general. </p>
<p>So  the  consciential  basement  is  the  phase  during  which  the individual  knows  more  but  is  manifesting  less;  it  is  when  the consciousness manifests as a poor resemblance of itself. </p>
<p>The  consciential  basement  includes  traits  such  as  aggression  and egocentricity, an inability to concentrate, lack of organization, lack of maturity  and  respect  and  attitudes  that  are  not  ethical.  Many  fears and  insecurities  also  reside  at  this  low  level  of  awareness.  So  the consciential basement is like the sewerage of the personality, for want of a better expression. </p>
<p>The  lower  chakras  predominate  during  the  consciential  basement, i.e. the spleen chakra, umbilico-chakra and sex chakra. These chakras are  related  to  the  primitive  needs  of  physical  survival,  things  like territorialism, food, water, shelter, sex and other forms of gratification but  not  to  things  like  studying  or  self-improvement.  During  the consciential  basement  a  person  is  a  slave  to  the  energies  of  these lower  chakras  rather  than  the  master  of  them.  This  prevents  the individual  from  recovering  full  awareness  of  who  he  really  is  and inhibits his evolution. An example of this is when a person becomes obsessed with sex. He (or she) spends so much time thinking about it that he finds it difficult to concentrate on anything else, and the need for gratification becomes the focus of his life. In situations like this a person’s decision-making abilities are often negatively affected as his rationality is completed dominated by his physical urges. </p>
<p>So  the  starting  point  for  investing  in  our  evolution  as consciousnesses  is  to  overcome  our  consciential  basement,  i.e.  our infantile tendencies and our “animal” drives and instincts. In order to become  the  maximum  of  who  we  really  are,  this  should  ideally  be achieved between the ages of 18 and 26, the age at which we reach, <a id="p150"></a>biological maturity. </p>
<p><b>Factors That Keep Us Stuck in the Consciential Basement and Tips for Overcoming Them</b></p>
<p><b>Genetics</b></p>
<p>Examples of traits inherited via our genetics that can keep us stuck in the  consciential  basement  include  laziness,  self-indulgence,  low  self-discipline  or  self-motivation,  mean-spiritedness,  aggression, arrogance,  isolation  from  others,  and  manipulation  and  control  of others, to name a few. </p>
<p>A  good  technique  for  overcoming  these  and  other  traits  that paralyze our evolution is the strong and weak traits formula. In the previous  chapter,  I  described  how  you  can  correct  any  false perceptions you may have of yourself by asking others to draw up a list of your strong and weak traits. You can use the resulting list for this exercise, or, if you’re not ready to involve others, you can make this  a  personal  exercise  that  you  do  alone.  Success  in  this  case,  of course,  depends  on  your  willingness  to  face  yourself  with  sincerity. </p>
<p>Once you have the list, put the two columns, strong traits and weak traits, side by side. Our strong traits dynamize our efforts to evolve, so the aim of this exercise is to maximize the evolutionary profit you can derive from them by seeing how you can use them to overcome your weak traits. </p>
<p>For example, perhaps you are the type of person who hates conflict of  any  kind  and  because  of  it  you  fail  to  stand  up  for  yourself properly. That is a weak trait that may be undermining your efforts to achieve what you want at work or in your personal life. But perhaps you identify that one of your strong traits is your inherent self-respect. </p>
<p>So your aim is to start behaving in a way that is coherent with that and to stop people from walking all over you even if the price to pay means having to deal with conflict. </p>
<p>Another example, perhaps even knowing it’s not ethical, you love to gossip and involve yourself in other people’s business. This is one of your weak traits. But maybe on your list of strong traits you identify that you have a strong will. So the idea is that you use your will to force  yourself  to  walk  away  from  any  situation  in  which  others  are gossiping. Every time. No exceptions. </p>
<p><a id="p151"></a><b>Paragenetics and Holomemory</b></p>
<p>Other factors that can keep us stuck in our consciential basement are our  paragenetics  and  holomemory.  As  they  transport  scars accumulated  from  past  life  traumas  to  the  current  life  via  the extraphysical and mental bodies, they may be the cause of unhealthy pathologies  and  neuroses  such  as  addictions,  aversions  and  phobias that range from the mild to the obsessive. </p>
<p>For example, perhaps you have a phobia of enclosed spaces that is crippling  your  self-confidence,  preventing  you  from  realizing  your true  potential  and  hindering  your  evolution.  Or  perhaps  you  have suffered an ordeal such as a rape, a violent attack, or a car accident in which others died, and the resulting trauma has had so much impact that  you  feel  unable  to  work  or  function  as  a  normal  member  of society. </p>
<p>The solution to these types of hindrances is to be prepared to let go of attachments to and repercussions of traumatic experiences. </p>
<p> <i><b>If we hold on to traumatic experiences and the effects they have on us, be they physical, emotional or mental, we condemn ourselves to  suffering  from  them  repeatedly  in  our  future  lives.  We  have  to face them at some point either in this life or a future one, so it might as well be today. </b></i></p>
<p><b>Environment</b></p>
<p>Environmental  factors  that  can  hinder  us  from  overcoming  our consciential  basement  stem  from  the  physical  environment  and  the culture into which we were born. For example, were you pressured to marry  and  have  children  at  a  young  age—was  your  life  filled  with commitments  and  obligations  to  others  before  you  even  knew  who you were? Did the religion in which you were raised brainwash you into not questioning its dogmas? What level of education did you have access to? </p>
<p>Some  of  these  factors  are  difficult  to  deal  with  because  we  have been  conditioned  to  accept  them  from  a  very  early  age.  There  is  a solution to overcoming them, however, and it lies in being prepared to think as an individual, independently of others. This may mean you have  to  go  against  the  accepted  norms  of  society,  even  against  the beliefs  of  your  friends  and  family,  and  rely  instead  on  your  own, <a id="p152"></a>analysis,  judgment,  personal  experiences  and  reference  points  when deciding  how  to  prioritize  your  life.  This  will  undoubtedly  be challenging to some extent but the alternative is to live your life a bit like a sheep, unquestioningly following the rest of the flock—behavior that favors stagnation not evolution. </p>
<p><b>Tips for Recovering More Advanced Levels of Awareness (i.e. Awareness of Who You Are beyond the Physical Body)</b></p>
<p>We  have  already  seen  how,  during  the  period  between  lives,  some lucid individuals are fully conscious of the fact that they are no longer alive in the physical sense; they are aware that they have died; that they have had many previous lives and that they have many lives yet to live. Some, already understanding that the consciousness evolves, plan their next physical life in such a way as to take best advantage of the  opportunities  to  further  improve  and  develop.  More  about  this specific planning is explained in the next chapter. </p>
<p>One of the great challenges that such individuals face as they move through  physical  life  is  to  recover  this  more  advanced  level  of awareness;  that  is,  to  remember  their  multidimensional,  multiserial existence,  and  their  more  advanced  skills  such  as  their  psychism  or their ability to master their energies. If they manage to do this, they can then live their lives in a way that is more coherent with what they planned during their last intermissive period, if they choose. </p>
<p>If you are still reading this book, there is every chance that you are just such a person—that you were lucid in your last period between lives.  How  do  I  know?  Because  these  ideas  make  sense  to  you, otherwise  I  assume  you  would  have  stopped  reading  long  ago.  As  I mentioned  in  <a href="index_split_000_split15.html#p110">chapter  6, </a>  many  of  these  ideas  are  prompting  semiconscious  retrocognitions,  just  helping  to  remind  you  of  what  you already know. </p>
<p><b>Study Multidimensional Realities</b></p>
<p>When  we  study  the  complexities  of  multidimensional  realities,  we trigger the download of information from our mental body, reminding ourselves of so many things we knew and understood before we were born.  We  start  to  recover  awareness  of  who  we  are  beyond  this physical  body,  awareness  that  has  been  temporarily  blocked  by  our, <a id="p153"></a>physical existence. My point here being—study the consciousness and all  its  associated  phenomena—read  and  learn  with  discernment  not only from conscientiology but from a wide variety of sources, and see where the consensus lies. This will prompt you to recover your more advanced levels of awareness until hopefully the maximum amount of awareness  corresponding  to  your  evolutionary  level  has  been regained. </p>
<p><b>Put Theory into Practice</b></p>
<p>Assuming  that  we  manage  to  gain  this  awareness  and  have experiences that enable us to  <i>know</i> that we are much more than just the  physical  body,  then  in  order  to  evolve  we  must  apply  what  we know. To  know something  in theory  is  not enough  because  without application  nothing  changes.  Resisting  change,  however,  is  a  well-documented human foible. In general, people far prefer to stick to the familiar  habits  that  don’t  present  them  with  any  challenges  or  risks and with the routines that make them feel safe. </p>
<p>But we have two choices. We can either rely on routines and stick to what we know—for most people this means prioritizing short-term concerns that relate to the current, physical life such as survival, and beyond that, material wealth, comfort, pleasure and status. Or we can consciously make decisions based on the fact that as consciousnesses we still have hundreds of lives ahead of us along our multiexistential journey.  Increasing  your  maturity,  and  thus  evolving,  requires  that you want to live your life in a manner that is coherent with the fact that  you  are  more  than  just  the  physical  body,  that  you  are  a consciousness;  and  if  necessary,  that  you  undertake  some  personal "recycling”  and  start  to  live  in  a  way  that  is  consistent  with  this reality. </p>
<p>Let  me  give  some  examples  of  the  sorts  of  changes  you  may consider initiating if you decide you want to “recycle” your life and prioritize your evolution:</p>
<p>•    Let  go  of  attachments  to  materialism,  prestige  and indulgence. Of course there is no requirement for anyone to suffer in order to evolve; everyone is entitled to have a decent life, to have a roof over his head, food on the table three times a day and a reasonable level of comfort. But what do we really need beyond that? We can dedicate our lives to accumulating more and more, <a id="p154"></a>money, properties and cars but we can’t take these things with us when  we  die.  They  are  of  no  use  to  us  in  the  extraphysical dimension and they won’t be waiting for us when we return to physical life next time. But what else could we achieve with all the  time  we  spend  accumulating  and  maintaining  material possessions? What else could we do with our wealth? Who could we help? </p>
<p>•  Be determined to be more of who you really are (according to your  multidimensional,  multiserial  history)  and  be  consistent with  that  throughout  your  life.  Refuse,  for  example,  to  allow yourself to get stuck in a rut in which you accept less than what you  deserve.  If  you  are  not  happy  with  your  boyfriend  or girlfriend, don’t keep complaining about it, do something about it. If you are in a poorly paid profession that you despise, retrain and find something that is more suited to you. </p>
<p>•    Make  an  effort  to  get  rid  of  behavioral  patterns  that  you justify to  yourself even  though you  know  they are  not positive. </p>
<p>For  example,  do  you  fly  off  the  handle  at  the  slightest provocation  or  inconvenience,  making  the  people  in  your  life tiptoe on eggshells around you, and blaming your short fuse on their frustrating behavior? If so, work at overcoming your weak traits. Don’t take them with you into your next life. </p>
<p>For sure, it is easy for me to sit here and write these things and just as easy for you to read them, right? But what about actually doing them? </p>
<p>In some cases we’re talking about unravelling deep-seated habits and attitudes that we have had for many, many lives, so where and how do we begin? </p>
<p><b>Harness the Power of Your Mental Body</b></p>
<p>The key to destroying the root of your problems and recycling your life lies in harnessing the power of your mental body. A good place to start  is  to  apply  one  of  its  most  powerful  attributes,  your  will,  to transform your thoughts, intentions and ideas, and then to align your behavior  so  it  is  consistent  with  them.  If  you  remember  what  was explained  in  the  chapter  on  bioenergy,  when  we  alter  our  thoughts our energies follow suit, as the two are inextricably linked. When you change  the  way  you  think,  you  create  a  new  energetic  field  around you that will open you up to synchronicities, intuitions, connections, <a id="p155"></a>and relationships with others that will support what you are trying to achieve. </p>
<p>For an immersive experience in the processes and consequences of changing  the  way  you  think,  I  recommend  seeing  the  highly motivating  film   <i>The  Secret. </i>  Although  it  doesn’t  address  the mechanisms of what happens when you change your thoughts from a multidimensional  perspective,  interviews  with  high-profile philosophers, authors, healers and ordinary folk alike, provide many real-life  accounts  and  examples  of  how  immensely  powerful  our thoughts are. Remember, what you think—is. If you truly believe you can accomplish anything you set your mind to, you will. If you truly believe that you are persecuted and that everyone is against you, life will not flow in your favor. </p>
<p>Other attributes of the mental body that are invaluable tools in our evolutionary  toolbox  are  our  concentration  and  attention.  If  we  can develop  our  capacity  to  continuously  fix  our  attention  on  a predetermined objective, the sky is the limit in terms of what we can achieve. We can learn and master some new types of intelligence for example, intelligence of course being another attribute of the mental body.  Once  upon  a  time  intelligence  was  measured  by  one’s intelligence  quotient  (IQ)  only,  but  nowadays  it  is  recognized  that intelligence  is  multifaceted.  To  take  psychic  intelligence  as  just  one example of a form of intelligence; think how fantastic it would be if you  could  develop  yours  to  the  point  of  being  able  to  accurately interpret what was going on around you extraphysically at any given moment  and  to  respond  appropriately  with  your  energies  to  reduce intrusion  in  your  life,  increase  interaction  with  your  helpers  and provide  practical  assistance  to  individuals  in  need.  Such  an accomplishment  would  have  a  significant  impact  on  your  level  of evolution, and believe me, you  <i>can</i> do it! </p>
<p>I offer these few suggestions to give you a flavor of the power of the mental body. Look back  over  <a href="index_split_000_split9.html#p29">chapter  1  </a>that  describes  the  bodies  of manifestation of the consciousness—will, concentration, attention and intelligence  are  just  some  of  the  many  positive  attributes  of  the mental  body  listed  there.  Familiarize  yourself  with  the  others,  for these  are  the  keys  to  your  evolution.  Think  about  improving  those that you already possess and developing those that you don’t. </p>
<p><b>Existential Self-Mimicry: The Stagnation of Consciential</b></p>
<p><a id="p156"></a><b>Evolution</b></p>
<p>To  conclude  this  chapter,  I  would  like  to  expand  a  little  upon  the subject  of  existential  self-mimicry,  which  I  briefly  referred  to  in  an earlier chapter. It is pertinent to bring it up here because existential self-mimicry  is  what  results  when  we  become  complacent  with  life and don’t see any point in changing. It is what results when we don’t consciously and actively manage our evolution. Self-mimicry is when we  repeat,  <i>ad  nauseam</i>,  the  same  human  experiences,  professions, partners,  lifestyles,  nationalities,  gender,  choices  and  priorities  over many physical lives. It is when there is nothing new from one life to the next. It is a common human tendency to repeat past lives because most of us prefer to do what is easy and what we know. So if we want to better ourselves, we need to identify and eliminate any unnecessary self-mimicry from our lives. </p>
<p>Reading  back  over  this  chapter,  I  can  understand  you  might  be feeling a little overwhelmed at this point, thinking that it is beyond your capacity to bring about the changes you feel you need in your life. If so, it might help to keep in mind the following excellent advice from Confucius who wrote:</p>
<p>“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” </p>
