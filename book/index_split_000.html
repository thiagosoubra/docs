<p>LESS INCOMPLETE</p>
<p> <i>This  is  one  of  the  greatest  books  I’ve  ever  been  given  because  it  is  the summary of my whole process … accessible to most people. </i></p>
<p><b>Dr. Waldo Vieira</b> (deceased), Consciousness Researcher; Author, <i>Projectiology: A Panorama of Experiences of the Consciousness Outside the Human Body This is an important book for those who are curious about the possibility of the  existence  of  other  levels  of  consciousness  besides  that  of  the  purely physical body. It is based on the research of Waldo Vieira, which includes a  very  large  number  of  personal  experiences,  particularly  out-of-body experiences,  col ected  throughout  his  life.  Sandie  Gustus  is  excel ently placed  to  describe  Vieira’s  discoveries  as  she  has  been  practicing  and teaching  his  theories  for  many  years  and  has  considerable  personal knowledge of a range of energetic and paranormal phenomena. </i></p>
<p><b>Dr. Peter Fenwick</b>, BA, MB, BChir, DPM, FRCPsych, Consultant Neuropsychiatrist emeritus, Epilepsy Unit, Maudsley Hospital, London, UK; Senior Lecturer, Institute of Psychiatry, London, UK; Coauthor (with Elizabeth Fenwick) of  <i>The Art of Dying Sandie  Gustus  has  written  a  provocative  and  eloquent  book  focused  on those aspects of exceptional human experience that are often overlooked, and even derided and pathologized by mainstream science, medicine, and media. However, these accounts are ignored at society’s risk because they can  not  help  but  enlarge  and  enrich  the  boundaries  of  the  human condition. </i></p>
<p><b>Stanley Krippner</b>, PhD., Professor of Psychology, Saybrook University, San Francisco, Calif., USA; Co-editor,  <i>Varieties of Anomalous Experience: Examining the Scientific Evidence Any comprehensive understanding of consciousness requires incisive tools for studying the subjective aspects of human experience. The careful and systematic  assessment  of  out-of-body  experiences  described  in  this  book comprises a valuable scientific resource for approaching this complex and</i></p>

<p><b>Brenda Dunne, </b> Laboratory Manager, Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) laboratory; President, International Consciousness Research Laboratories (ICRL); and co-author (with Robert Jahn) of  <i>Margins of Reality: The Role of Consciousness in the Physical World</i> and  <i>Consciousness and the Source of Reality: The PEAR Odyssey.  Drawing  from  personal  experiences  grounded  in  the  theories  presented, Sandie Gustus speaks with the authority of someone who has studied the work of Dr. Waldo Vieira for many years at the International Academy of Consciousness  (IAC).  The  concepts  of  consciousness  being multidimensional  and  multiexistential  are  explored  in  depth  and  the explanations  discussed  engender  a  moral  code  for  living,  encouraging readers to consider their own actions with regards to others. The book also offers  practical  guidance  for  those  curious  to  experience  the  phenomena discussed. This is a welcome addition to the literature on the exploration of consciousness. </i></p>

<p> <i>This  book  is  pivotal  in  raising  awareness  of  Waldo  Vieira’s  scientific research  among  the  general  population.  It  thoroughly  explains  the  main principles of his work and provides practical guidelines for understanding consciousness at a very personal level. As we go forward in the twenty-first century  and  beyond,  it  is  critical  to  raise  awareness  of  and  facilitate regaining  contact  with  the  nonphysical  realms  of  existence  in  order  to revolutionize  science  as  we  know  it  and  this  book  makes  an  important contribution to achieving this. </i></p>

<p> <i>At  last,  Dr.  Vieira’s  major  contribution  to  both  science  and  spirituality through first-person research of out-of-body experience, subtle energy and psi is made available in “plain English” with accompanying techniques — a must-read  for  both  lay  readers  and  scholars.  Sandie  Gustus’  own experience with these phenomena and their potential to enrich and clarify “regular” life is evident throughout the book, as wel . </i></p>
