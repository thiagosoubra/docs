<p>Identifying Your Purpose in Life</p>
<p>If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. </p>
<p>If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. </p>
<p>Whatever good things we build end up building us. </p>
<p> <i>—Jim Rohn</i></p>
<p>Even though appearances can suggest that all is well in our world and that  our  life  is  on  track,  e.g.  we  have  a  fulfilling  career,  financial independence  and  family  and  friends  around  us,  sometimes  we  feel empty  inside.  We  have  a  strong  intuition  that  something  is  missing from  our  lives—that  there  is  something  else  we  are  supposed  to  be doing only we don’t what that is. These sensations can indicate a life plan we haven’t yet fulfilled. </p>
<p>If you feel this way, start asking yourself the question, “What am I here to do in this physical life?” </p>
<p>It’s a big question, obviously, and setting about finding the answers can seem daunting. Fortunately there are several tools and resources at hand to help you to recall or identify your life plan. Take a look at the following:</p>
<p><b>Personal Strong and Weak Traits Formula</b></p>
<p>You have already learned in previous chapters how to identify your strong and weak traits. I would recommend for this purpose that you tap  into  the  knowledge  and  experiences  that  your  friends,  family, colleagues  and  even  foes  have  of  you,  to  enrich  and  bring  more objectivity to the lists of your personal traits. Remember, your strong traits  include  all  of  your  qualities,  attributes,  aptitudes,  capabilities, skills,  intelligences  and  talents  while  your  weak  traits  include  your vices, defects, limitations, inabilities, bad habits and immaturities. </p>
<p>The resulting lists, two columns side by side, hold clues not only to your past, but also to your present. How so? </p>
<p>First, our life is planned in such a way that the accomplishment of, <a id="p174"></a>the  goals  we  set  ourselves  requires  that  we  draw  on  our  unique combination of positive traits. It makes sense to draw on as many of our  strengths  as  possible  if  we  are  striving  to  achieve  something significant, doesn’t it? So for the purpose of this exercise, rather than analyzing  each  of  your  strong  traits  in  isolation,  try  to  see  what  is unique about the  <i>combination</i> of your strengths. Let’s go back to the example  of  the  plastic  surgeon  in  the  previous  chapter  who  was making  his  fortune  performing  breast  enhancements  in  LA  and  was off-track  with  his  life  plan.  If  he  had  applied  the  strong  and  weak traits formula to arrive at the conclusion that he should leave LA and take  his  skills  to  the  third  world,  we  could  hypothesize  that  he identified a combination of strong traits along the following lines:</p>
<p>•  an education in medicine</p>
<p>•  surgical skills and the “stomach” for the profession</p>
<p>•    a  second  language  as  he  was  raised  in  a  bilingual environment</p>
<p>•  an ability to easily learn other foreign languages</p>
<p>•  a strong will and determination to achieve set objectives</p>
<p>•  compassion for the suffering of others</p>
<p>•  adaptability</p>
<p>•  humility</p>
<p>You can see that for the doctor to take his highly specialized skills to the world’s poorest countries, where the supply of such skills is low but the need for them is high, is in keeping with how life plans are formulated. The doctor both wanted and was able to do his aid work effectively because of his medical training and compassionate nature, his language skills, and his ability to adapt to foreign cultures and less comfortable living conditions. </p>
<p>So  then,  what  about  you?  You  don’t  have  to  be  a  surgeon  or  a politician  or  a  rock  star  with  a  conscience  to  have  something worthwhile to offer or something meaningful to do with your life, so don’t  underestimate  yourself.  Remember,  no  two  people  are  exactly the  same,  even  identical  twins.  Try  to  identify  what  is  special  and unique about your set of positive traits. And then see how you can use them  to  help  yourself  and  others.  This  will  provide  you  with  some, <a id="p175"></a>clues as to your purpose in life. </p>
<p>Second, our life is also planned to provide us with opportunities to face  and  overcome  our  weak  traits.  Let’s  consider  again  the hypothetical case of the doctor. Perhaps he had a fear of flying that he had  to  overcome  in  order  to  execute  his  life  plan.  Perhaps  he  was inherently a shy person but the nature of his work turned him into a minor celebrity in his field of work so he had to learn to cope with the attention. </p>
<p>Again,  what  about  you?  If  you  are  hiding  in  the  safety  and predictability  of  your  comfort  zone,  embrace  the  opportunities  to confront  your  weaknesses  and  fears.  If  you  do  this  of  your  own accord,  you  avoid  the  crises  and  traumas  that  result  when circumstances  beyond  your  control  force  you  to.  This  is  assuming control of your life. This is evolution. </p>
<p><b>Personal Reciprocation Formula</b></p>
<p>Another formula that can help us to identify and understand our life plan is the personal reciprocation formula which, in a nutshell, is this. </p>
<p>Is there a balance between what you have received from life and what you have given back? What did you receive from life? Did you have a good  education?  Do  you  have  a  rewarding  job  or  career,  a  loving partner  and  family?  Was  your  upbringing  devoid  of  any  hardship? </p>
<p>Sometimes  during  the  preparation  phase  of  our  lives,  the  helpers further invest in us by providing us with additional opportunities that will help us to execute our life plan later in life. So try to think if you received anything unusual or uncommon when you were growing up. </p>
<p>For  example,  did  you  have  a  mentor  who  took  a  special  interest  in you, did you inherit money or a property, did you grow up bilingual or  trilingual,  did  you  have  access  to  the  best  universities  or professions  through  family  connections,  did  you  have  many  lucid OBEs or other psychic episodes as a child, did you meet a partner who was very supportive of your personal development, etc? </p>
<p>What if you have had all these means to evolve, the helpers have invested  in  you  and  everything  has  been  in  place  to  support  your evolution  since  you  were  born  but  you  don’t  evolve?  Then  these things you have been given are luxuries and privileges that you take for granted. After the age of 35, we have to think about reciprocating, about giving something back to life. And we can do this by assisting, <a id="p176"></a>others. When thinking about how our assistance can have the greatest net effect on others, there are two things to bear in mind. First, strive to  engage  in  actions  that  have  the  greatest  collective  impact—it  is better  to  help  1000  people  than  just  one  person.  And  second, assistance  generally  falls  into  one  of  two  categories—it  is  either consolation  or  clarification.  I  will  define  these  in  greater  detail  in <a href="index_split_002_split3.html#p180">chapter  12  </a>but  briefly,  as  I’ve  mentioned  before,  when  we  clarify others  we  teach  them  how  to  help  themselves,  and  this  is  the  very best kind of assistance we can give. </p>
<p>So for the purpose of this exercise, I suggest you make a list of all the  things  that  you  have  received  from  life  so  far  and  then  list everything that you have given back. Is there a balance? If not, and you are already into the second half of your life, start thinking about how  you  can  reciprocate  today.  Once  you  begin  to  pay  back, according to the suggestions given, your life plan will begin to unfold. </p>
<p><b>Lucid Out-of-Body Experiences</b></p>
<p>The most effective means of identifying our purpose in life is to learn how  to  produce  lucid  projections  at  will,  because  there  are  several ways in which we can discover our life plan outside of the body. For example:</p>
<p>•    When  we  have  lucid  OBEs  it  is  possible  to  access  our holomemory, in which the details of what we planned for this life prior to being born are stored. </p>
<p>•  You could choose to meet with one of the helpers who was responsible  for  developing  your  life  plan.  He  might  say,  “Look you  have  forgotten  what  we  agreed  and  you  are  off  track. </p>
<p>Remember, we planned that you would do x, y and z, etc.” But take note, if you recall experiences like this out of the body you have to be sure that (a) they were lucid experiences and (b) you were  communicating  with  a  helper,  not  an  intruder  or  blind guide. </p>
<p>•    Or  you  could  try  to  meet  with  your  evolutionary  orientor while out of the body. </p>
<p>•    Another  target  for  a  lucid  projection  could  be  your extraphysical  hometown.  This  is  where  you  attended  the intermissive  course  and  did  your  training  and  preparation  for, <a id="p177"></a>your  current  physical  life,  so  it  will  be  easier  for  you  to  recall your life plan if you reach this target. There, you can also meet the  extraphysical  members  of  your  groupkarma,  some  of  whom may be able to confirm your recollections. </p>
<p>What  will  determine  the  level  of  success  you  have  with  all  your projective objectives is the strength of your will, so don’t consider any of  these  targets  to  be  beyond  your  capability.  Be  determined.  Don’t give up. </p>
<p><b>Retrocognitions</b></p>
<p>Producing a retrocognition of your most recent intermissive period is another  technique  for  recalling  your  life  plan.  You  can  try  the retrocognitive  self-hypnosis  technique  as  described  in  <a href="index_split_000_split17.html#p133">chapter  8</a>,  or you  could  book  a  session  in  a  retrocognitarium,  a  laboratory especially  designed  to  facilitate  the  recollection  of  past  lives  and intermissive  periods,  more  details  of  which  were  also  provided  in <a href="index_split_000_split17.html#p133">chapter 8</a>. </p>
<p><b>One-Year-More Technique</b></p>
<p>Once  we  have  either  obtained  some  clues  to  or  have  identified  our purpose in life, there are a couple of useful techniques we can employ to  dynamize  its  execution,  should  we  be  in  need  of  some  extra impetus. </p>
<p>The one-year-more technique is a technique that can help us when our motivation starts to flag, and is very simple in its strategy—live every year as if it were your last. </p>
<p>Imagine  you  went  to  visit  your  doctor  today  and  he  told  you, </p>
<p>“Sorry, but you have a terminal illness and you will die in exactly 365 days from today.” Meaning, you have only one year left in which to fulfill your life purpose. What would you do with the remaining time? </p>
<p>What  would  you   <i>not</i>  do?  Imagine  this  is  actually  your  situation. </p>
<p>Adopting this posture can inspire and motivate us to reprioritize our lives and to realize several years’ worth of obligations that make up our  life  plan,  in  just  twelve  months.  In  this  context,  here  are  some useful steps to consider taking for the next 365 days. </p>
<p>•  Identify the projects and goals that you have fostered for a long  time  but  haven’t  yet  managed  to  fulfill  and  draw  up  a schedule that is geared towards accomplishing these priorities in, <a id="p178"></a>one year. </p>
<p>•    Eliminate  all  activities  that  are  unnecessary  for  the achievement of your priorities. </p>
<p>•  Be disciplined, sleep a little less and give yourself some extra time. </p>
<p>•  Identify your most powerful strong trait and increase what you can produce from it. </p>
<p>•  Produce as much as you can from your time and energy and from  the  opportunities  that  come  your  way,  without compromising your health. </p>
<p>•  Improve your karma by nurturing positive relationships with your family, friends, colleagues, adversaries, and even your pets; and express your affection and fraternity to all people. </p>
<p><b>50-Times Technique</b></p>
<p>Another  technique  for  dynamizing  your  life  plan  is  the  50-times technique, which works like this—whatever you need to do properly and with quality, do it 50 times. For example, do the vibrational state 50 times a day; learn every technique for leaving the body properly by attempting each one 50 times; dedicate 50 times longer to every worthwhile task undertaken; have 50 times more motivation and 50 times more attention. </p>
<p>In other words, develop the positive attributes of perseverance and tenacity and see the evolutionary results for yourself. </p>
<p><b>Books and Courses</b></p>
<p>Other  resources  I  can  recommend  that  are  useful  in  both  the identification and galvanization of one’s life plan include a book by Waldo Vieira entitled  <i>Existential Program Manual. Existential program</i> is the term coined by Vieira that refers to the “specific programming of each human personality for their new life in this physical dimension.” </p>
<p>( <i>Vieira</i>, 1997)</p>
<p>The International Academy of Consciousness, which has educational centers around the world, and the Brazil-based International Institute of  Projectiology  and  Conscientiology  both  offer  courses  that  are specifically  designed  to  assist  interested  individuals  to  identify  their, <a id="p179"></a>life  plan.  Please  refer  to  the  appendix  for  contact  details  of  these organizations.  They  will  be  glad  to  provide  you  with  additional information. </p>
<p><b>Precautions</b></p>
<p>A final word or two about the realities of attempting to discover your true direction in life. </p>
<p>First, you should prepare yourself for the possibility that you won’t learn all of the details of your life plan in advance. So if you have an idea,  a  clue,  a  hint  as  to  what  you  should  be  doing  with  your  life, don’t stand still, move in that direction. Put one foot in front of the other. From your new position, more ideas will be revealed and things will gradually become clearer as you keep moving forward. </p>
<p>Second, as is the case with all endeavors, bear in mind that life is rarely  perfect.  So  while  it  would  be  ideal  if  all  our  needs  could  be taken  care  of  and  life  was  calm  and  stress-free  before  we  started thinking  about  executing  our  real  purpose  in  life,  this  may  never happen. As I said in the previous chapter, if you want to find excuses not to fulfill your life plan you will always find them. “I don’t have enough money, I don’t have a girlfriend, I don’t own a house yet, my mother is sick, etc.” I am not advocating being reckless or failing to assume  your  responsibilities—not  at  all.  I’m  just  cautioning  against procrastination. </p>
