<p>Clues to Past Lives</p>
<p>Do you know who you are? </p>
<p> <i>—Dostoevsky</i></p>
<p>Many  years  ago  I  used  to  go  diving  regularly  with  some  very experienced divers. One instructor in particular used to put on a kind of underwater magic show that was just fabulous to experience. As we swam  alongside  the  reefs,  examining  the  corals,  peering  into  rocks and caves and bringing the vivid colors to life under the light of our flashlights,  he  would  draw  on  his  knowledge  to  expose  clever camouflages,  transforming  apparently  lifeless  environments  into scenes that thrived with activity. </p>
<p>In a similar way, suggestions of past lives are all around us. It’s just a  matter  of  knowing  how  and  where  to  look.  Once  we  develop  an understanding  of  some  subjects  that  might  be  new  to  many  of  you, such  as  the  complete  or   <i>holo</i> memory  of  the  consciousness, paragenetics (genetics that we pass to ourselves from one life to the next), pathologies of the mental body, the tendency to mimic previous lives,  semi-conscious  recollections  of  past  lives  and  energetic affinities, we can start to perceive the clues to former existences that are discretely woven into the fabric of our everyday lives. </p>
<p>The concept of seriality (the series of successive lives) helps throw light  on  some  quirks  of  human  nature  that  are  widely  accepted  as being real but are poorly understood, such as “love at first sight” and various  aversions  and  disorders  that  have  no  apparent  basis.  More importantly  though,  through  meticulous  scientific  research,  notably that of the late Ian Stevenson MD, former head of the Department of Psychiatry  and  founder  and  director  of  the  Division  of  Personality Studies  at  the  University  of  Virginia  in  the  US,  seriality  has  been shown  to  be  a  plausible  determining  factor  in  some  physical  and psychological  conundrums  that  have  long  baffled  modern  medicine, such as some birthmarks, birth defects and phobias. </p>
<p><a id="p111"></a>Given  the  success  of  Dr.  Stevenson’s  work,  the  question  that naturally arises is what other enigmas might benefit from a scientific perspective  that  acknowledges  that  the  consciousness  survives  the death of the physical body and is subject to a long series of successive lives?  What  existing  theories  that  preclude  this  viewpoint  can adequately  explain  all  the  cases  of  the  Savant  syndrome,  of  genius, child prodigy and exceptional talent; xenoglossy (unlearned language) or gender dysphoria, for example? </p>
<p>In this chapter I examine some clues to past lives, some of which seem to be the result of scientific investigation and others that can be corroborated  through  personal  experience.  In  the  next  chapter  I proffer  an  explanation  of  the  mechanisms  that  allow  past-life experiences,  skills  and  knowledge  to  manifest  in  a  later  physical existence. </p>
<p><b>Phobias</b></p>
<p>In  the  context  of  past-life  experiences,  it  seems  more  logical  to examine  children’s  phobias  as,  due  to  their  young  age,  there  is considerably  less  likelihood  that  the  phobia  could  be  linked  to  a current-life experience. </p>
<p>In  encountering  children  with  phobias,  child  psychiatrists commonly  attempt  to  treat  phobias  that  neither  they  nor  the children’s parents can explain in that they are not the result of any known incident or trauma nor do they correspond to a similar fear in a  family  member.  Bearing  this  in  mind,  the  hypothesis  that  some phobias relate to past-life traumas becomes even more compelling in light  of  a  tentative  classification  of  children’s  phobias  drawn  from research and clinical experience that was proposed by Miller, Barret and Hampe (as cited by A. Davids, 1974). </p>
<p>Among the phobias proposed were many that one could reasonably understand a child developing, such as phobias of snakes and spiders, high  places,  air  travel,  deep  water,  being  seen  naked,  social interactions,  getting  an  injection,  reciting  in  class,  and  being criticized.  But  there  were  also  several  that  would  seem  to  defy  any logical explanation in the context of the present life of a young child and,  moreover,  could  be  considered  to  have  more  relevance  to  past societies  than  present.  These  include  phobias  relating  to  poisoned food,  germs,  wars  and  riots,  members  of  another  race,  breaking  a <a id="p112"></a>religious law, being kidnapped and going crazy. (A. Davids, 1974<a href="index_split_002_split13.html#p248">)2 </a>Of course, a conscientious study of individual cases would be required to ascertain whether or not the roots of any phobias present in children do in fact stem from past-life experiences. </p>
<p>This  is  precisely  what  Ian  Stevenson  did  for  four  decades, thoroughly interviewing and investigating over 2600 cases of reported reincarnation, scientifically substantiating many past-life memories by methodically sifting actual real-life experiences from intuitions, claims and  beliefs.  His  approach  was  to  construct  a  case  history  of  each individual  by  corroborating  the  life  of  the  personality  remembered with existing historical data, such as medical and civil records, and by interviewing  people  still  living  who  remembered  the  previous personality  and  who  were  able  to  confirm  the  stories  that  the  child claimed to have lived. </p>
<p>The subjects of Stevenson’s work were mostly children, the majority from  countries  and  cultures  that  believe  in  reincarnation,  who professed to remember previous lives. </p>
<p>In one particular study of 387 such children, phobias were found to occur  in  141  (36  percent).  Some  of  these  children  exhibited  the phobia before learning to speak and so couldn’t explain the phobia in the  context  of  the  remembered  life  to  their  family.  Commonly,  the phobias  corresponded  to  the  cause  of  death  of  the  previous personality. One subject, a Sri Lankan girl by the name of Shamlinie Prema,  for  example,  demonstrated  two  phobias  as  an  infant;  one  of water, the other of buses. Her parents were at a loss to explain them. </p>
<p>Over  time,  as  Shamalinie  learned  to  talk,  she  began  to  describe  a previous life in which she had died at the age of eleven. She said that she had gone out to buy bread one morning and the road was flooded. </p>
<p>A  passing  bus  splashed  water  all  over  her  and  when  she  stepped backwards  to  get  out  of  the  way,  she  fell  into  a  paddy  field  and drowned. (Stevenson, 2001)</p>
<p>In many instances, the children’s phobias related specifically to the instrument responsible for the death of the previous personality, such as guns, knives and swords, while a few of the subjects had phobias of the place where the death occurred. </p>
<p>In general, Stevenson’s study produced results that strongly pointed to the possibility of past lives. Among 47 cases in which the previous personality  had  drowned,  a  phobia  of  being  submerged  in  water <a id="p113"></a>occurred  in  30  (64  percent).  Among  the  30  cases  in  which  the previous personality died of snakebite, a phobia of snakes occurred in 43 percent. (Stevenson, 2001)</p>
<p>While  the  actual  incidence  of  children’s  phobias  in  the  general population  is  difficult  to  quantify,  according  to  a  study  by  King, Hamilton and Ollendik (1994), it is thought to be between only 3 and 8  percent,  making  it  considerably  more  difficult  to  dismiss  these connections as pure coincidence. </p>
<p><b>Birthmarks and Birth Defects</b></p>
<p>Similarly,  there  are  many  recorded  instances  of  people  with birthmarks  or  birth  defects  that  have  no  known  genetic  or  prenatal cause. </p>
<p>Stevenson investigated 210 such cases in which subjects exhibited birthmarks,  birth  defects  and  other  abnormalities  that,  according  to them, were related to events experienced in a previous life. Existing medical records, often post-mortem reports, verified the recollections of  many  of  the  subjects,  proving  in  43  of  the  210  cases  the distinguishing marking or feature on the current physical body to be linked  to  a  wound,  often  fatal,  incurred  by  the  individual  in  a previous existence. (Stevenson, 2001)</p>
<p>One of these files tells the story of Haşim Köybaşi, a Turkish man who  had  died  in  a  postelection  riot  in  Turkey  in  1963.  Haşim’s postmortem  report  showed  that  he  had  died  from  a  bullet  that  had entered his head behind the left ear. The bullet almost emerged on the right  side  of  his  neck  but  the  examining  pathologist  had  to  make  a small incision to extract it. Many months later, a female relative gave birth  to  a  son,  Metin  Köybaşi,  who  was  born  with  birthmarks corresponding  to  the  entry  and  exit  wounds  of  the  bullet  that  had killed  Haşim.  Developing  a  tendency  that  was  common  in  other children  in  Stevenson’s  study,  as  he  grew  older,  Metin  became extremely  vengeful  towards  the  man  who  had  shot  Haşim.  Once, intent  on  shooting  him,  he  even  tried  to  take  his  father’s  gun. </p>
<p>(Stevenson, 1997)</p>
<p>Birth  defects  can  be  defined  as  major  deformities  and  are  usually characterized by the partial or complete absence of fingers, toes, arms, legs,  ears  or  other  organs.  As  cited  by  Stevenson  (1997),  the  three known causes of birth defects are genetic factors such as chromosomal <a id="p114"></a>abnormalities; certain infectious diseases, drugs and other toxins; and conditions that occur in the uterus when the fetus is developing, such as  overcrowding  during  multiple  pregnancies.  When  these  known causes are excluded however, large numbers of birth defects remain unexplained with some studies showing this incidence to be as high as 65–79 percent (Wilson, 1973)</p>
<p>In his book  <i>Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of  Birthmarks  and  Birth  Defects  Vol.  2</i>,  Stevenson  presents  25  case studies of subjects who had major birth defects of the extremities, in other words, they were missing either fingers, toes, hands or feet. All but two of the subjects claimed that the previous personality had died a violent death, with more than half of them occurring in Myanmar (formerly Burma). </p>
<p>Among  the  Burmese  subjects,  some  remembered  lives  that  took place under the British rule in Burma, others had memories relating to the  ensuing  pandemonium  of  the  defeat  of  the  Japanese  army  in 1945,  and  four  claimed  to  have  been  Japanese  soldiers  who  fought and died in Burma during Word War II. The subjects’ memories were consistent with the facts relating to these periods in Burma’s history. </p>
<p>All of the previous personalities of the Burmese subjects were killed with swords with the exception of one who died in a bomb explosion. </p>
<p>Five of the subjects claimed to have been tortured before being killed, saying that their killers had chopped off some of their fingers and toes first. This form of torture was known to have been carried out by the Burmese on Japanese stragglers separated from their army. Three  of the  subjects  said  that  they  had  lost  fingers  when  they  raised  their hands in self-defence or to plead for mercy. Unlike the others, these three manifested birth defects of the hands but not of the toes. </p>
<p>In considering any likelihood of a birthmark or birth defect being linked to a trauma incurred by an individual in a previous life, it is worth bearing in mind that in comparison to instances of birthmarks, most birth defects are rare. (Stevenson, 1997)</p>
<p><b>Xenoglossy and Glossolalia</b></p>
<p>Another phenomenon that sometimes puzzles modern science but may make  sense  in  the  context  of  past  lives  is  that  of  xenoglossy. </p>
<p>Xenoglossy  is  the  ability  to  speak  in  a  language  that  has  not  been learned in the current life. In some cases, a person can also write in <a id="p115"></a>the unlearned language (xenography). </p>
<p>Religious  literature,  especially  that  of  spiritualism,  is  proliferated with accounts of the related phenomenon of glossolalia or “speaking in tongues” which is the ability to utter words or sounds of a language unknown to the speaker, usually as an expression of religious ecstasy. </p>
<p>The following appears in the New Testament of the Bible for example, </p>
<p>“And  they  were  all  filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost,  and  began  to  speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.” (Acts 2: 4). In Christianity, the supernatural ability to speak in unknown languages was interpreted as a gift bestowed by the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>Authentic  cases  of  xenoglossy,  in  which  a  person  speaks  a  real language  that  is  completely  unknown  to  him  in  his  normal  state  of consciousness,  are  very  uncommon,  and  properly  documented  cases are  even  rarer.  Most  cases  of  apparent  xenoglossy  can  in  fact  be dismissed as a person speaking nonsense, a gibberish invented by the subconscious  mind,  as  instances  of  possession  or  telepathic communication involving mediumism, or as fraud. </p>
<p>There  are  two  distinct  types  of  xenoglossy,  recitative  and responsive. In recitative xenoglossy the person is unable to converse in the foreign language but can repeat some words or phrases in rote style,  without  necessarily  understanding  what  they  mean.  In responsive  xenoglossy,  the  person  is  able  to  communicate  in  the foreign  language  in  an  intelligent  manner.  Authentic  cases  of responsive  xenoglossy  are  much  rarer  than  those  of  the  recitative kind. (Stevenson, 1974)</p>
<p>The  following  example  of  recitative  xenoglossy  was  cited  by researcher, author and founder of the magazine  <i>Spiritism</i>, Frenchman Gabriel Delanne in 1924. </p>
<p>An Italian family by the name of Battista, from the Rome area, lost their  young  daughter  Blanche  in  1902.  Three  years  later  Signora Battista, who was pregnant, had an experience in which the deceased child appeared to her saying she was coming back to the family, so when Signora Battista gave birth to a daughter in 1906, she and her husband (who reported the case) named her Blanche also. </p>
<p>When the first Blanche had been alive, the family had employed a Swiss maid who only spoke French. She had taught Blanche to sing a French  lullaby.  As  the  girl  had  left  the  family’s  employ  soon  after <a id="p116"></a>Blanche  had  died,  the  family  soon  forgot  about  the  lullaby,  so  they were astounded one day to hear the second Blanche singing the  old French  lullaby  when  she  was  about  five  years  old.  It  hadn’t  been heard  in  the  Battista  household  for  nine  years.  When  they  asked Blanche  who  had  taught  her  the  song  she  replied,  “No  one,  I  just know  it  by  myself.”  (Stevenson,  1974)  As  the  child  was  not  able  to converse in the foreign language, only recite, this was an example of recitative xenoglossy. </p>
<p>One  of  the  best-known  cases  of  genuine  responsive  xenoglossy  is that  of  “T.  E.,”  a  37-year-old  housewife,  investigated  by  Stevenson, who was born and raised in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>T.  E.’s  Russian  parents  had  emigrated  to  the  US  from  Odessa, Russia.  Neither  of  them  had  ever  been  to  Scandinavia  nor  knew anyone well who could speak any of the Scandinavian languages. T. E. </p>
<p>was raised in an English-speaking society and her family spoke mostly English together. </p>
<p>During a session of regressive hypnosis under her husband K.E., a physician in Philadelphia, it was discovered that T. E. was easily able to  enter  deep  trances,  so  he  began  to  experiment  with  her  more systematically.  Under  hypnosis  one  day  soon  after  the  more  regular sessions began, T. E. announced that she was a man by the name of Jensen Jacoby and then briefly described his life as a peasant farmer. </p>
<p>She  spoke  in  a  deep  masculine  voice.  This  was  the  first  session  of several conducted between 1955 and 1956 at which Jensen appeared. </p>
<p>In  the  sixth,  seventh  and  eighth  sessions,  Jensen  communicated almost  exclusively  in  an  early  form  of  colloquial  Swedish  that  was spoken before the industrial revolution. All sessions from the fourth onwards  were  recorded  except  the  eighth  at  which  detailed  notes were taken. </p>
<p>After  thoroughly  investigating  this  case  and  examining  both  the recordings  and  transcripts  of  the  hypnosis  sessions,  Stevenson  was able  to  establish  its  authenticity  as  an  example  of  responsive xenoglossy by discounting any possibility of fraud or cryptomnesia (in which  a  language  is  learned  early  in  life  but  later  forgotten). </p>
<p>Extrasensory  perception  was  postulated  as  a  third  possible  cause  as Swedish-speaking interpreters had to be present during the sessions to test  T.  E.’s  knowledge  of  Swedish,  but  Stevenson  reasoned  that  this hypothesis was very unlikely as Jensen’s speech was smattered with a <a id="p117"></a>considerable  number  of  Norwegian  words  while  the  interpreters  all preferred Swedish. </p>
<p>Dr. Stevenson spent over eight years working directly on the Jensen case  and  recruited  linguists  and  other  experts  and  scientists  who thoroughly  investigated  every  alternative  explanation.  In  summary, having  dispensed  with  the  three  explanations  mentioned  above, Stevenson concluded that it was impossible to understand this case of responsive  xenoglossy  without  assuming  that  a  personality  who  had learned Swedish before 1956 had survived the death of his physical body.  This  personality  could  be  a  nonphysical  consciousness temporarily speaking through the hypnotized T. E. or he could be an aspect of T. E.’s own personality. While Stevenson didn’t believe that the  data  provided  a  stronger  evidence  for  either  of  the  two possibilities,  nor  provide  absolute  proof  of  reincarnation,  he  did however propose reincarnation as a plausible hypothesis, especially as Jensen  was  evoked  only  by  suggestions  of  regression.  (Stevenson, 1974)</p>
<p>In  more  recent  times,  Professor  Adrian  Finkelstein,  an  established author  and  psychiatrist  in  Los  Angeles,  recounted  the  true  story  in <i>Your  Past  Lives  and  the  Healing  Process</i>  of  a  boy,  Robin  Hull,  who remembered his past life as a Tibetan monk. Robin often spoke in a language  his  mother  couldn’t  understand.  When  a  friend  of  Robin’s mother who believed in reincarnation heard the strange language she invited  another  friend  who  was  a  professor  of  Asian  languages  to Robin’s  house.  Eventually,  the  professor  was  able  to  identify  the language as a dialect spoken in the northern regions of Tibet. When he asked the boy where he had learned the language, the boy replied "at  school.”  When  his  mother  reminded  him  that  he  hadn’t  started school yet, Robin said that he went to school a long time ago and then explained  that  he  didn’t  like  to  talk  about  his  past  life  because  the only time he had attempted to, his mother had ignored him. With the professor’s encouragement, Robin described very precisely his past life as a Tibetan monk, so precisely in fact that the professor decided to go in search of the place. He eventually found the monastery  of  which Robin spoke in the Kuen Lun Mountains. (Finkelstein, 1996) If  some  instances  of  phobias,  birthmarks,  birth  defects  and xenoglossy  can  be  shown  through  scientific  research  to  be  plausible manifestations  of  reincarnation,  then  it  stands  to  reason  that  there <a id="p118"></a>may  be  other  clues  to  past  lives,  some  more  commonplace,  also worthy  of  investigation.  Here  are  some  examples  that  seem suggestive, to varying degrees, of a prior existence of the personality. </p>
<p><b>Prodigies, Exceptional Talents and Early Achievers</b> A prodigy is defined as a person who manifests exceptional talents or powers at an early age, displaying expert proficiency in a field that is usually the exclusive domain of adults. A prodigious talent, although always remarkable, is even more so when evident in a child who has had  neither  the  time  nor  opportunity  to  acquire  such  highly developed  skills  in  the  current  life,  nor  inherited  a  genetic predisposition towards the skill from his family. </p>
<p>Some of the reasons given for exceptional talent in children include a  particularly  strong,  positive  parental  interest  and  attention  in  the child (perhaps because the child was an only child, was sick or was born late in the father’s life), or the child spending a large portion of his time in the company of adults and imitating and being influenced by exceptional parents. (Radford, 1990) The latter reason is evident in the  cases  Mozart  and  Picasso,  for  example,  two  of  the  world’s  most famous child prodigies. These three reasons however, do not account for all cases of prodigies. </p>
<p>According  to  the  “nature-nurture”  theory,  we  are  all  a  product  of our  genetic  inheritance  and  our  environment.  While  there  are  no definitive  answers  as  to  what  makes  a  prodigy  break  this  mold, general  consensus  among  researchers  is  that  a  prodigy  is  rather  the product  of  environment  (which  includes  factors  such  as  nationality, culture,  level  of  education,  religion,  socioeconomic  status  and opportunities to practice the skill in addition to the factors mentioned in  the  previous  paragraph)  and  innate  talent.  But  what  exactly  is innate talent? British psychologist and author, John Radford, claims that  while  special  talents  are  essentially  innate,  the  genetic mechanism  behind  this  is  not  clear.  He  admits  that  “special  talents and precocity are simply unusual cases of general laws which have yet to be elucidated.” (Radford, 1990)</p>
<p> <i><b>According  to  the  science  of  conscientiology,  innate  talents  are readily  explained  as  talents  that  a  person  can  inherit  (along  with many other things) from himself, via his holomemory (complete or integral memory) and paragenetics. </b></i> These mechanisms are explained <a id="p119"></a>in full in the next chapter. </p>
<p>Certainly it is not difficult to find examples of children exhibiting skills  and  strong  tendencies  that  seem  to  indicate  something  more than  behavior  of  an  exceptional  level  of  maturity  and  development, suggesting  in  some  cases  a  “carrying  forward”  of  familiar,  habitual behaviors  from  past  lives.  In   <i>Child  Prodigies  and  Exceptional  Early Achievers</i>  for  example,  Radford  describes  a  photo  carried  in  the (London)   <i>Times</i>  on  June  29,  1988  of  Prime  Minister  Thatcher inspecting the press credentials of a young journalist at the meeting of European leaders in Hanover, Germany. The journalist was 12-year-old Alexander Blume reporting for his school newspaper,  <i>The Mole. </i></p>
<p>In other examples cited by Radford, the  <i>Early Times</i>  of  California, dated December 27, 1988, reported the story of Tony Aliengena, aged nine, who became the youngest solo pilot in California, taking off and landing  an  ultralight  plane.  The  following  year  he  piloted  a  plane around the world. </p>
<p>And on August 24, 2001,  <i>The Guardian</i> in the UK reported the story of Arran Fernandez who, at age five, had become the youngest person to  pass  a  GCSE  exam,  in  mathematics.  A  perfect  example  of  the environment/innate  talent  hypothesis,  Arran  was  an  only  child  who had  been  educated  by  his  parents  at  home  in  Surrey  but  who nonetheless  accomplished  feats  that  would  far  surpass  the expectations of what such advantages might bring when he discovered some  integer  sequences  previously  unknown  to  research mathematicians.  These  were  later  published  in  an  international research encyclopedia. </p>
<p>If the theories relating to holomemory and paragenetics as proposed by Vieira are correct, then it stands to reason that a person would be able to inherit negative behaviors and tendencies as well as positive ones. Examples of extreme negative tendencies in children that cannot be explained away by the child’s environment or genetic inheritance but appear to be innate, are similarly not so difficult to find. </p>
<p><b>Genius</b></p>
<p>A  study  of  genius  also  turns  up  numerous  examples  of  people  of extraordinary  intellectual  and  creative  powers  that  challenge  the nature/nurture  theory,  hinting  instead  at  capacities  and  talents  that have  been  learned,  developed,  “remembered”  and  perfected  by  the <a id="p120"></a>consciousness over many lives. </p>
<p>How else can we adequately explain the case of classical composer George Handel (1685–1759) for example, who came from a family of no musical distinction and received no formal musical training apart from lessons taken with the organist at his local church  as  a  young child?  His  father  was  strongly  against  his  interest  in  music  and  his mother offered him no real support. (Stevenson, 2001) Against these odds,  Handel  nonetheless  became,  during  his  lifetime,  perhaps  the most internationally acclaimed of all musicians. </p>
<p><b>The Savant Syndrome</b></p>
<p>Genius is even more difficult to explain within the limited parameters of  the  conventional  paradigm  when  it  manifests  in  people  who  are handicapped  in  almost  every  other  way,  as  is  the  case  with  some sufferers  of  the  savant  syndrome.  Could  it  be  that  holomemory  and paragenetics also play a role in this baffling paradox of superability and disability? </p>
<p>An   <i>idiot  savant</i>  (from  the  French   <i>idiot</i>  meaning  idiot  and   <i>savant</i> whose original meaning refers to a learned or knowledgeable person such  as  a  scholar,  philosopher  or  scientist)  is  an  extremely  rare condition in which a mentally handicapped person, usually incapable of learning, reading and writing, can accurately access highly specific and detailed knowledge in precise fields such as mathematics, music and the arts. Dustin Hoffman famously raised awareness of the Savant syndrome in the film  <i>Rain Man. </i> He played an autistic  <i>savant</i> who was able to memorize a staggering number of cards played at a blackjack table yet was incapable of making simple choices about what to eat or wear. </p>
<p>What is most perplexing about the autistic  <i>savants</i> is that they do not  gain  their  specialized  knowledge  through  learning.  They  just "know” precise, explicit information. Some, for example, are calendar calculators, such as the identical twins George and Charles who were extensively  studied  by  Darold  A.  Treffert,  a  Wisconsin  psychiatrist who  has  been  researching  the  savant  syndrome  for  more  than  40 years. </p>
<p>As cited by Treffert in  <i>Extraordinary People</i>, the first comprehensive work on this condition, George and Charles can tell you what day of the week corresponds to any past or future date you name, within a <a id="p121"></a>span  of  40,000  years.  They  can  also  tell  you  all  the  years  in  which your birthday fell on any given day of the week. They cannot however perform simple calculations such as addition and subtraction. </p>
<p>Another  case  studied  by  Treffert  that  received  a  great  deal  of attention  from  the  US  media,  is  that  of  the  prodigious   <i>savant</i>  Leslie Lemke. A prodigious  <i>savant</i> is defined as a handicapped person with skills  that  would  be  remarkable  even  in  a  normal  person.  This  was certainly Leslie Lemke’s case. Leslie, who had never had any formal instruction in music, heard Tchaikovsky’s  <i>Piano Concerto No. 1</i> for the first time one night during his teens. It was the sound track of a film he  was  watching  with  his  family.  Later  that  night,  his  family  was awakened by Leslie playing the piano—note for note, flawlessly and without hesitation—Tchaikovsky’s  <i>Piano Concerto No. 1. </i></p>
<p>Leslie can do this with any piece of music, no matter how long or complex.  This  feat  in  itself  is  remarkable.  Add  to  this  the  fact  that Leslie  is  blind,  has  cerebral  palsy,  is  severely  mentally  handicapped and cannot even manage to use a utensil to eat, and it would seem that some kind of paranormal explanation is called for. Conventional science,  at  least,  has  no  explanation  for  this  phenomenon.  (Treffert, 1989)</p>
<p>The  <i>idiot savant syndrome</i> was being studied as far back as the late nineteenth century by French psychologist Alfred Binet who devised the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) as a measurement of intelligence. But the condition remained a curiosity for many years. Not until recently has this apparently anomalous human condition been analyzed from what  is  known  in  psychology-speak  as  a  modular  view,  in  which, according  to  philosopher,  psychologist  and  author  Jerry  A.  Fodor, </p>
<p>“many  different  kinds  of  psychological  mechanisms  must  be postulated  in  order  to  explain  the  facts  of  mental  life.”  (Radford, 1990) I propose that facts of mental life will never fully be explained until an acknowledgment of the past lives of a consciousness is also incorporated into such a modular view. </p>
<p>All the clues to past lives discussed thus far are rare conditions not commonly  encountered  in  every  day  life.  So  let’s  now  look  at  some other clues with which you or someone you know are more likely to have had some direct, personal experience. </p>
<p><b>Love at First Sight</b></p>
<p><a id="p122"></a>Most of us have had the experience of feeling an “intuitive” attraction for  someone  upon  meeting  him  or  her  for  the  very  first  time.  A powerful but apparently baseless sentiment such as this can point to your past. When you “recognize” someone in this way, what you are often  recognizing  in  fact  is  that  person’s  unique  bioenergetic signature, the mixture and quality of energy, thoughts and emotions that is specific to him or her, a combination that you already know well  from  your  shared  past  together.  So  this  sense  of  instant familiarity can, in fact, be a semiconscious recollection of a past life. </p>
<p>Most  people  are  unaware  of  this  possibility  however  and  often misinterpret  the  “recognition”  of  a  stranger  as  love  at  first  sight. </p>
<p>Logically, as well as experiencing this sense of familiarity with those who  were  indeed  our  former  spouses  or  lovers,  we  may  also experience  it  with  others  we  were  particularly  close  to  in  previous lives, such as those who were once our parents, children, siblings or friends. </p>
<p><b>Aversions</b></p>
<p>On  the  flip  side  of  the  coin,  an  instant  dislike  or  repulsion  for  a stranger  upon  first  meeting  may  equally  be  a  semiconscious recollection of a former enemy or adversary. </p>
<p>Less intense than a phobia and more prevalent in everyday life, an aversion  is  defined  as  a  fixed,  intense  dislike  or  repugnance;  the avoidance  of  a  thing,  situation  or  behavior  because  it  has  been associated with an unpleasant or painful stimulus. In cases in which an aversion has no known cause, the possibility that the stimulus may be rooted in a past existence should be considered. </p>
<p>For example, I know a man who is perfectly normal and likeable. </p>
<p>He  had  a  stable,  loving  upbringing;  is  considerate;  funny  and unpretentious  and  excels  in  his  chosen  profession.  Paradoxically,  he has  apparently  never  had  an  intimate  relationship,  neither heterosexual  nor  homosexual,  despite  now  being  in  his  mid-forties. </p>
<p>Clearly, he has an aversion to intimacy yet there is no evident cause for this. Could it be that he was sexually violated in a previous life? It is possible. Or maybe he spent many consecutive past lives leading up to  this  one  as  a  religious  figure,  perhaps  a  priest  or  monk,  whose dogma was that sex was wrong. Or perhaps he is just terribly shy but hides his inhibitions well. Again, we should never make assumptions about  anything  without  knowing  all  the  facts.  There  are  many <a id="p123"></a>plausible  explanations  for  such  situations—the  point  I’m  making  is that  explanations  that  have  their  origins  in  a  past  life  are  also plausible. </p>
<p> <i><b>A cursory glance at world events reveals ample potentialities for the  development  of  future  life  aversions,  if  not  full-blown  phobias,  for  thousands  of  unfortunate  victims  of  natural  and  man-made disasters. </b></i></p>
<p>We can logically hypothesize that some Hajj pilgrims trampled to death  in  human  stampedes  in  Mecca  might  develop  an  aversion  to crowds  in  future  lives;  that  some  of  the  victims  of  the  2004  Boxing Day tsunami might manifest an aversion to the water or the ocean; or that  some  of  the  eleven  million  Jews,  Gypsies,  Poles  and  other European ethnic groups exterminated during the Holocaust of World War  II  might  manifest,  in  future  lives,  a  specific  aversion  to  the German race. </p>
<p><b>Gender Dysphoria</b></p>
<p>Another area in which we could hypothesize the impact of past lives on  a  consciousness  is  that  of  gender  dysphoria,  or  gender  identity disorder. </p>
<p>Some  people  experience  varying  degrees  of  incongruousness between  the  gender  they  feel  themselves  to  be  and  the  gender  they actually  are.  While  some  are  content  to  “role-play”  the  sex  they identify with in a homosexual relationship, others will go to extreme lengths  physically,  emotionally,  psychologically,  socially  and financially  to  live  a  life  that  outwardly  matches  their  internal understanding  of  what  gender  they  are.  This  may  include incorporating  behaviors  such  as  cross-dressing  into  their  lifestyle (transvestism)  or  taking  the  drastic  measure  of  changing  their  sex through medical intervention (transexualism). </p>
<p>Research has shown that there is no scientifically proven cause of transexualism. Nor is there any known psychological cure. </p>
<p>An  incorporation  of  an  understanding  of  multiserial  realities  into the counselling and treatment of gender dysphoria could potentially bring  much  relief  to  many  who  describe  themselves  as  having  the body of one sex and the desires of another. </p>
<p>Consider  the  following,  for  example.  People  commonly  live  their <a id="p124"></a>physical lives according to a series of safe routines that don’t present any risk or challenge, routines that they like and with which they are comfortable. Some people are so attached to their routines that they endlessly  repeat  a  variety  of  aspects  of  their  physical  manifestation over  many  lives—things  like  their  profession,  nationality, geographical location,  type of  partner and  gender.  This is  known  in conscientiology  as  existential  self-mimicry,  a  topic  that  will  be examined in more detail in <a href="index_split_002.html#p147">chapter 9</a>. </p>
<p>Take then the case of a consciousness who has led ten consecutive lives  as  a  man.  Imagine  that  the  helpers  eventually  decide  that  this consciousness needs to be born as a female in the next life, in order that it can have some new experiences, learn from them and progress as a consciousness, and so it experiences physical life as a woman for the first time in more than a thousand years. In this context it is not so difficult to understand its malaise with its new gender. </p>
<p>By the same token, depending on the individual, an understanding of  this  broader  reality  may  help  a  person  to  take  advantage  of  and embrace  the  experience  of  being  born  a  particular  gender.  It  is  an opportunity  to  gain  empathy  for  the  members  of  that  sex  through firsthand experience, to learn some new skills and capacities that the experience  of  being  that  sex  affords,  and  above  all,  to  develop  the positive attributes of flexibility and adaptability. </p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that what I’m proposing is just one of many  possible  explanations  for  the  conditions  of  homosexuality, transvestism and transexuality. </p>
<p><b>Ideological Affinities</b></p>
<p>A last example of clues to a person’s past lives or intermissive periods is  one  that  I  have  witnessed  regularly  in  class  as  an  instructor  of conscientiology. </p>
<p>Many students come to our courses with no prior, lucid experience of OBEs or any other paranormal or energetic phenomena. They come because they are looking to make sense of their existence, to broaden their view of reality and to understand their role within it. </p>
<p>Throughout  our  core  course,  the  Consciousness  Development Program  (CDP),  students  are  exposed  to  all  manner  of  subjects  that would seem fantastical or just plain crazy to the average person out <a id="p125"></a>on  the  street—all  the  things  discussed  in  this  book—mastery  of energies,  helpers  and  intruders,  past  lives  and  intermissive  periods, out-of-body  flights  to  other  dimensions  and  planets,  etc.  Yet  it  is blatantly obvious that for most of our students, nothing could be more logical and rational. Often this is because they are not in fact being taught anything they don’t already know, for they attended training courses  during  their  last  intermissive  period  in  preparation  for  this current life in which they studied many of the topics that we teach in the  CDP.  In  this  case,  the  classes  themselves  trigger  semiconscious recollections of classes attended in the intermissive period, which, in turn, translate into a strong sense of rapport with the information and ideas being discussed. </p>
<p>The following quotes from students confirm this theory: When I was first introduced to the science of conscientiology, the majority  of  the  information  which  was  being  presented  felt  very intuitive and logical to me. In fact, the greater challenge and the focus  of  my  mental  effort  were  more  in  comprehending  the conscientiological terminology used to describe the ideas, than the ideas themselves. (Glenn Hitchman, UK)</p>
<p>After my first course with the IAC I had a feeling as if I had been travelling  in  a  foreign  country  for  such  a  long  time  and  finally  I found someone whose language I actually understood! It all felt so familiar and clear to me. (Ines Rusteberg, Germany) Other  affinities  with  ideologies  and  religions,  cultures,  languages, customs, habits and traditions, and even likings and cravings for foods foreign to the environment into which an individual was born, may in some cases be due to connections with experiences in previous lives. </p>
